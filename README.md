ToS Salad ü•ó
Making Terms of Service Digestible for Everyone

Mission Statement
ToS Salad is a non-profit educational project dedicated to making online Terms of Service accessible and understandable for everyone. We believe that informed consent is a fundamental digital right. Our tools are designed to empower users, promote transparency, and foster a more equitable online world.

We are funded by community donations and generate no profit.

The Problem: The Collapse of Informed Consent
The current digital economy has systematically destroyed informed consent through engineered complexity:

The Consent Fraud:

Obfuscation through Complexity: 15,000-word documents written in dense legalese that no reasonable person reads
Hidden True Costs: Services marketed as "free" while harvesting extensive personal data for surveillance capitalism
Coerced Consent: Essential digital infrastructure requiring take-it-or-leave-it agreements
Copyright as Censorship: Legal barriers preventing public analysis of these critical documents
The Result: Billions of people have unknowingly signed away fundamental rights to privacy, data ownership, and digital autonomy.

Our Response: Restore digital honesty by making the opaque transparent.

Our Approach: The "Red Flag Detector"
Rather than providing legal advice or full summaries, ToS Salad operates as an educational "Red Flag Detector" that identifies and explains concerning clauses in plain English.

Methodology: Quote and Explain
Our analysis follows a strict methodology designed for legal safety and educational clarity:

‚ö†Ô∏è Data Sharing & Third Parties:
Original Text: "We may share your information with our partners, affiliates, and third-party service providers..."
Plain English Explanation: "This clause suggests the company can share your data not just internally, but with other companies for marketing purposes."
Key Principles
Direct Quotation: Extract specific clauses verbatim from source documents
Neutral Analysis: Provide factual explanations without inflammatory language
Educational Purpose: Focus on helping users understand, not providing legal advice
Fair Use Protection: Quote only what's necessary for educational commentary
Legal Framework
ToS Salad operates under established Fair Use doctrine, which explicitly protects:

Criticism and commentary on published works
Educational analysis of public documents
Transformative use that adds new meaning or purpose
We are not republishing entire documents or competing with the original sources. We are providing educational context to help users understand what they're agreeing to.

Technology Strategy
Open Source Commitment
Full Transparency: All code publicly available for inspection
Community Auditing: Open review of AI prompts and analysis methodology
Trust Through Verification: Nothing to hide, everything to verify
Sustainable Architecture
Curated Library: Focus on most important/requested ToS documents
Caching Strategy: Analyze once, serve many times
Human Review: AI-assisted analysis with human quality control
Cost Management: Strategic use of AI APIs with local processing where possible
Community-Driven Development
Funding Model
Community Donations: Direct support from users we serve

Disclaimer
ToS Salad is an educational tool, not a lawyer. Our analysis is AI-assisted and for informational purposes only. Do not rely on this for legal decisions. Always consult qualified legal counsel for specific situations.
