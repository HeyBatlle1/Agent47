  const youtubeContent = `YouTube (Google) Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 18/100
Justification: YouTube's Terms of Service systematically exploit content creators through dual licensing schemes, aggressive monetization rights, and liability transfers that make creators financially responsible for platform legal costs. The agreement treats creators as unpaid content suppliers while extracting maximum value through advertising revenue and automated enforcement systems. The score reflects the platform's transformation of creative expression into surveillance capitalism while transferring all legal and financial risks to individual creators.

1. The Double License: Giving Rights to YouTube AND Every Other User
Original Text: "License to YouTube: By providing Content... you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content... License to Other Users: You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content... only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds)."
Plain English Explanation: This is a crucial distinction. You are not just giving a license to YouTube. You are simultaneously giving a separate license to every single user on the planet to watch and interact with your video through YouTube's features. This is the legal foundation that makes the entire platform work.

2. The Right to Monetize: YouTube Can Put Ads on Your Video and Keep the Money
Original Text: "You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments."
Plain English Explanation: This clause explicitly gives YouTube the right to run ads on or next to your videos and collect all the revenue from those ads. Unless you are a member of the separate YouTube Partner Program, you are not entitled to any of that money. You provide the content, they keep the profits.

3. The Liability Cap: The Infamous $500 Limit
Original Text: "YOUTUBE AND ITS AFFILIATES' TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT YOUTUBE HAS PAID TO YOU FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE DATE OF YOUR NOTICE... OF THE CLAIM; AND (B) USD $500."
Plain English Explanation: This is YouTube's version of the liability cap. If you are a regular user who doesn't earn money from the platform, their maximum liability to you for any harm they cause is $500. This is higher than most other platforms' $100 cap but is still a trivial amount compared to potential damages.

4. Full Indemnification: You Pay Their Legal Bills
Original Text: "To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates... from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from... your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right..."
Plain English Explanation: This is a critical clause for creators. If you use a clip of a movie or a song in your video and the copyright owner sues YouTube, this clause means you are legally obligated to pay for YouTube's lawyers and all associated costs. It transfers the entire risk of copyright infringement from the platform to the creator.

5. Automated Content Scanning and the "Strike" System
Original Text: "We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse... YouTube operates a system of "strikes" in respect of Content that violates the YouTube Community Guidelines. Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube."
Plain English Explanation: This describes their enforcement mechanism. Your videos are constantly scanned by AI to detect violations. If a violation is found, you are issued a "strike." Accumulating strikes can lead to restrictions and the permanent deletion of your channel and all of its content. This automated system is often criticized for its errors, but it is the core of their content moderation.

6. Service Termination and Content Loss
Original Text: "YouTube may terminate your access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately... Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms of Service will also terminate and you must immediately cease all use of the Service."
Plain English Explanation: YouTube can delete your channel and years of creative work at any time, for any reason or no reason at all. All the time, effort, and creativity you invested in building your channel can be permanently destroyed with no recourse and no compensation.

7. Content Ownership vs. Platform Control
Original Text: "You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to YouTube, you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license..."
Plain English Explanation: While you technically "own" your content, YouTube's license is so broad that this ownership becomes practically meaningless. They can use, modify, and distribute your content in any way they see fit, and even transfer these rights to other companies, all without paying you unless you're in their partner program.

YouTube's Terms of Service create a systematic exploitation of creative labor where creators bear all legal and financial risks while the platform extracts maximum advertising value from their unpaid content creation.
