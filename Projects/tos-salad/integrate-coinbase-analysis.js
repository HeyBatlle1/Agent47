const coinbaseAnalysis = `Coinbase User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 5/100
Justification: This document is an almost perfect example of a predatory, user-hostile legal agreement. It is a labyrinth of cross-referenced policies that culminates in one of the most comprehensive forced arbitration and class action waiver clauses in the industry. It grants Coinbase extraordinary power, including the right to take a user's assets to cover their losses (the "setoff" and "security interest" clauses) and the right to suspend access to a user's funds and account at its sole discretion. These powers, combined with absolute disclaimers of liability for the security and operation of its platform, create a system of total corporate control over a user's digital assets with virtually no meaningful legal recourse for the user. It is a legal masterpiece of risk transference.

1. The Ultimate Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Your Legal Rights are Annihilated
Original Text: "WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL... By entering into this Agreement, you... agree to waive your right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action lawsuit... ALL DISPUTES... MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS."
Plain English Explanation: This is the most dangerous and important clause in the entire document. You are permanently and completely forbidden from suing Coinbase in a real court of law. You are explicitly banned from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit if Coinbase suffers a catastrophic hack, systemic failure, or engages in practices that harm millions of users at once. You are forced into a secret, private, and individual arbitration process. This clause is specifically designed to make it practically impossible to hold the company accountable for large-scale failures.

2. The Power to Seize Your Assets: The "Setoff" and "Security Interest" Clauses
Original Text: "Setoff and Security Interest. You grant us a lien on, and a right of setoff against, and a security interest in, all of your rights, title and interest in and to... all of your Digital Assets and Fiat Currency... for any and all obligations and liabilities you owe to us... We may setoff any of your liabilities or obligations to us against any of your rights, title or interests in and to any of your Digital Assets and Fiat Currency, without notice to you."
Plain English Explanation: This is an extraordinary and aggressive clause. It means that you grant Coinbase a legal claim (a "lien" and "security interest") over all the money and crypto you hold in your account. If Coinbase decides you owe them money for any reason (like a disputed transaction or a system error), this clause gives them the right to take your assets directly from your account to cover the debt, without even notifying you. This effectively gives them the power of a debt collector and a court, combined.

3. The "Sole Discretion" Kill Switch: They Can Freeze Your Account and Funds at Will
Original Text: "We may, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice... suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Coinbase Services, and/or deactivate or cancel your Coinbase Account(s)."
Plain English Explanation: This clause gives Coinbase the absolute, dictatorial right to freeze you out of your account and prevent you from accessing your money and crypto at any time, for any reason they choose. They do not need to provide a warning or an explanation. In the volatile crypto market, being unable to access your funds for even a short period can be financially catastrophic. This clause gives them total control over your market access.

4. The "Unclaimed Property" Clause: If You Go Inactive, Your Crypto Goes to the Government
Original Text: "If Coinbase is holding funds... and has no record of you interacting with the Coinbase Services for several years, Coinbase may be required to report these funds as unclaimed property in accordance with applicable law... If this occurs, Coinbase will attempt to locate you at the address shown in our records, but if Coinbase is unable to locate you, it may be required to deliver any such funds to the applicable state or jurisdiction as unclaimed property."
Plain English Explanation: If you do not log in to your account for a period of several years (the exact time depends on state law), Coinbase may be legally required to hand over all of your crypto and cash to the state government as "unclaimed property." While this is a legal requirement, many users are unaware that their long-term "hodl" strategy could result in their assets being seized by the state if they are not actively managing their account.

5. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Hacks or Losses
Original Text: "IN NO EVENT SHALL COINBASE... BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND... ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE COINBASE SERVICES..."
Plain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. It states that Coinbase is not legally or financially responsible for losses you suffer, even if those losses are due to their system's failure, errors, or delays. Crucially, this is designed to protect them from liability in the event of a hack or security breach that results in the theft of your digital assets.

6. The "As Is" Warranty Disclaimer: The Platform is Not Guaranteed to Be Secure or Functional
Original Text: "The Coinbase services are provided on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory."
Plain English Explanation: Coinbase makes zero legal promises that its platform will work correctly, be reliable, or, most importantly, be secure. By using their service, you are legally accepting 100% of the immense risk associated with the technical and security failures of a cryptocurrency exchange, which can result in the total and irreversible loss of your assets.

This analysis is complete. The document is a legal fortress designed to grant the company maximum control over user assets while simultaneously absolving it of nearly all liability for the immense risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. The combination of the "setoff" clause and the forced arbitration clause is particularly predatory.`;
