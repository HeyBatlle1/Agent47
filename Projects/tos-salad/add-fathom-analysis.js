  const fathomContent = `Fathom Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 35/100
Justification: Fathom's Terms of Service demonstrate a mixed approach with some genuine user-friendly improvements over competitors (AI training opt-out, two-sided indemnification for paid users) while maintaining standard corporate legal protections. The agreement shows that better policies are possible in the conversation recording space, though it still employs forced arbitration, aggressive intellectual property clauses, and liability caps. The score reflects meaningful improvements in specific areas while preserving industry-standard risk transfer mechanisms.

1. The Same Forced Arbitration Gauntlet
Original Text: "...you agree that disputes between us will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND FATHOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING."
Plain English Explanation: Just like Otter.ai, Fathom forces you to give up your right to sue them in court or participate in a class-action lawsuit. Your only recourse is individual, binding arbitration, which limits your power as a consumer.

2. A Better AI Training Policy (With an Opt-Out)
Original Text: "We may use and create de-identified data generated from your User Content to train, customize or improve our in-house artificial intelligence models in order to improve our Service. You can opt out of the use of your de-identified data in this manner within your Fathom account settings."
Plain English Explanation: This is a significant and positive difference from Otter.ai. While Fathom also uses your data to train their AI, they provide you with a clear method to opt-out of this practice in your account settings. This gives you meaningful control over how your conversational data is used.

3. The Two-Sided Indemnity (But Only If You Pay)
Original Text: "We will indemnify and hold you harmless from any costs, damages, expenses, and liability caused by any third-party claim ("Claim") alleging that your use of the Service infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, or trademark... For the avoidance of doubt, Fathom's indemnity obligations of this Section do not apply to the free edition of our Service."
Plain English Explanation: This is rare and important. While you are required to pay Fathom's legal bills if you cause them to be sued (standard indemnification), they offer to do the same for you if their service infringes on a copyright or patent. This is a valuable protection for businesses. However, they explicitly state this protection does not apply to users of the free version.

4. The Aggressive "Your Ideas Are Ours" Clause
Original Text: "You acknowledge and agree that Fathom shall own all right, title and interest in the Feedback and is the sole exclusive owner of Feedback and you assign all rights, title and interest you have in such Feedback to Fathom together with all intellectual property rights therein."
Plain English Explanation: This is even more aggressive than Otter's clause. You are not just granting them a license to use your ideas; you are legally assigning full ownership of your ideas to Fathom. The moment you suggest an improvement, it is no longer yours in any capacity.

5. Team Account Data Belongs to the Company, Not You
Original Text: "If you sign up for our Service as an Authorized User as part of your company's business Team Account, the User Content in that Team Account belongs to your company."
Plain English Explanation: This is a critical warning for employees. Any meeting you record using your company's Fathom account does not belong to you. The recordings and all associated data are the legal property of your employer, who can access, review, or delete it at will.

6. The Standard $100 Liability Cap
Original Text: "...THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE FATHOM ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) US$100 AND (II) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU OR PAYABLE BY YOU... DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD..."
Plain English Explanation: Like the others, Fathom limits their total financial responsibility for any harm they cause you to a maximum of $100 or your last 12 months of fees. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for their potential failures.

7. Service Termination and Data Deletion
Original Text: "Fathom may terminate your access to all or any part of our Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice... Upon termination of your Account, your right to access and use the Service will terminate immediately. You acknowledge and agree that Fathom may immediately deactivate or delete your Account and all related information..."
Plain English Explanation: Fathom can delete your account and all your conversation recordings at any time, for any reason or no reason. They have no obligation to preserve your data after termination, meaning important meeting recordings could be permanently lost if they decide to close your account.

8. The Data Retention Ambiguity
Original Text: "We may retain some or all of your User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, fraud prevention, analytics, or audit purposes. We may also retain and use your User Content as necessary to comply with our legal obligations..."
Plain English Explanation: Like Otter.ai, Fathom gives itself broad discretion to keep your conversation data for undefined "commercially reasonable" periods. There's no clear commitment about when your recordings will be permanently deleted from their systems.

9. Third-Party Service Integration Risks
Original Text: "Your use of any third-party service to access our Service is solely between you and the applicable third-party service provider... We disclaim all liability with respect to these third-party services..."
Plain English Explanation: If you connect Fathom to other services (like Zoom, Slack, or calendar apps), Fathom disclaims all responsibility for how those integrations handle your data. If a connected service causes a data breach or misuses your recordings, Fathom accepts no liability.

While Fathom shows some improvements over industry norms with AI training opt-out and two-sided indemnification for paid users, it still employs standard corporate risk-transfer mechanisms that limit user rights and protections.
