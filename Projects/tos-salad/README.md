# ToS Salad 🥗 + The Verifier 🛡️
Making Terms of Service Digestible for Everyone + Content Verification for Digital Literacy

## Mission Statement
ToS Salad is a non-profit educational project dedicated to making online Terms of Service accessible and understandable for everyone. We believe that informed consent is a fundamental digital right. Our tools are designed to empower users, promote transparency, and foster a more equitable online world.

**NEW: The Verifier Integration** 🛡️
*"This is not just a feature; it's a statement. It takes the very tools used for deception and reforges them into shields for the public."*

The Verifier extends our transparency mission from legal documents to digital content itself, providing users with the same analytical capabilities that platforms use to monitor them - but in service of transparency rather than control.

We are funded by community donations and generate no profit.

## The Problem: The Collapse of Informed Consent
The current digital economy has systematically destroyed informed consent through engineered complexity:

### The Consent Fraud:

- **Obfuscation through Complexity**: 15,000-word documents written in dense legalese that no reasonable person reads
- **Hidden True Costs**: Services marketed as "free" while harvesting extensive personal data for surveillance capitalism
- **Coerced Consent**: Essential digital infrastructure requiring take-it-or-leave-it agreements
- **Copyright as Censorship**: Legal barriers preventing public analysis of these critical documents

### The Information Asymmetry Crisis:

- **Platform Analytical Advantage**: Companies have sophisticated tools to analyze user content (AI detection, metadata extraction, reverse image search)
- **User Analytical Deficit**: Users share content blindly, unaware of what information it contains or what rights they're surrendering
- **Digital Illiteracy by Design**: Platforms benefit from users not understanding content verification, privacy implications, or ToS correlations
- **Weaponized Ignorance**: The same tools used to detect AI content and track users are hidden from users themselves

**The Result**: Billions of people have unknowingly signed away fundamental rights to privacy, data ownership, and digital autonomy, while also sharing content that exposes them to additional risks they can't even see.

**Our Response**: Restore digital honesty by making the opaque transparent - in both legal documents AND digital content.

### The Signal Counter-Narrative: Proof That Predatory Clauses Are Choices 🌟

**Signal proves that user-centric Terms of Service are possible.** Signal operates a global communication service used by millions without:
- ❌ Perpetual content licenses
- ❌ Forced arbitration clauses
- ❌ Predatory liability caps
- ❌ Data mining permissions
- ❌ Surveillance capitalism terms

**The lesson**: When a platform's technical architecture and business model prioritize users over exploitation, the legal terms naturally become user-friendly. Every predatory clause in other platforms is a **choice**, not a necessity.

**Signal's gift to digital rights**: Concrete proof that "this is just how the internet has to work" is a lie.

## Our Approach: Dual Transparency Systems

### ToS Analysis: The "Red Flag Detector" 📜
Rather than providing legal advice or full summaries, ToS Salad operates as an educational "Red Flag Detector" that identifies and explains concerning clauses in plain English.

### The Verifier: Content Verification System 🛡️
The Verifier provides users with the same analytical capabilities that platforms use to monitor content, but for user empowerment rather than control:

- **🔍 AI-Generated Media Detection**: Analyze images/videos for AI generation with probabilistic scores
- **🕵️ Digital Provenance Check**: Reverse image search to find content source and context
- **🔬 Metadata Analysis**: Extract and explain hidden information in digital files
- **🛡️ Link & File Safety Scan**: Detect phishing attempts and malicious content

### Integrated Analysis Philosophy
Both systems follow the same principles:
- **Evidence, Not Verdicts**: Provide probabilities and analysis, never absolute claims
- **Transparency First**: All methods documented and open for review
- **Privacy Paramount**: No storage of user content or identifying information
- **Educational Purpose**: Empower critical thinking, don't replace it

### Methodology: Quote and Explain
Our analysis follows a strict methodology designed for legal safety and educational clarity:

> ⚠️ **Data Sharing & Third Parties**:  
> **Original Text**: "We may share your information with our partners, affiliates, and third-party service providers..."  
> **Plain English Explanation**: "This clause suggests the company can share your data not just internally, but with other companies for marketing purposes."

#### Key Principles
- **Direct Quotation**: Extract specific clauses verbatim from source documents
- **Neutral Analysis**: Provide factual explanations without inflammatory language
- **Educational Purpose**: Focus on helping users understand, not providing legal advice
- **Fair Use Protection**: Quote only what's necessary for educational commentary

## Legal Framework
ToS Salad operates under established Fair Use doctrine, which explicitly protects:

- Criticism and commentary on published works
- Educational analysis of public documents
- Transformative use that adds new meaning or purpose

We are not republishing entire documents or competing with the original sources. We are providing educational context to help users understand what they're agreeing to.

## Technology Strategy

### Open Source Commitment
- **Full Transparency**: All code publicly available for inspection
- **Community Auditing**: Open review of AI prompts and analysis methodology
- **Trust Through Verification**: Nothing to hide, everything to verify

### Sustainable Architecture
- **Curated Library**: Focus on most important/requested ToS documents
- **Caching Strategy**: Analyze once, serve many times
- **Human Review**: AI-assisted analysis with human quality control
- **Cost Management**: Strategic use of AI APIs with local processing where possible

## Community-Driven Development

### Funding Model
- **Community Donations**: Direct support from users we serve
- **Grant Funding**: Support from digital rights and consumer protection foundations
- **Fiscal Sponsorship**: Partnership with established non-profits for administrative support

### Collaboration
We actively seek partnerships with:
- Digital rights organizations (EFF, etc.)
- Academic researchers studying digital consent
- Journalists covering technology and privacy
- Other open-source privacy tools

## Disclaimer

### ToS Analysis Disclaimer
ToS Salad is an educational tool, not a lawyer. Our analysis is AI-assisted and for informational purposes only. Do not rely on this for legal decisions. Always consult qualified legal counsel for specific situations.

### The Verifier Disclaimer
The Verifier provides content analysis for educational purposes only. It offers probabilities and evidence, not absolute determinations. The tool:

- **Provides estimates, not certainties** - All results are probabilistic assessments
- **Cannot guarantee accuracy** - AI detection and verification methods have limitations
- **Respects privacy** - Files are analyzed locally and deleted immediately after analysis
- **Is not a security tool** - Should not be relied upon as sole protection against threats
- **Empowers critical thinking** - Results should inform, not replace, human judgment

Always use multiple verification methods and apply critical thinking to any content analysis results.

## Usage
