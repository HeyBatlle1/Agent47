  const spotifyCreatorsContent = `Spotify for Creators Terms: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 40/100
Justification: While this is a B2B agreement, it employs many of the same user-hostile tactics as the consumer ToS. It grants Spotify a sweeping, perpetual license to artist content and feedback, forces artists into binding individual arbitration (a severe limitation for a business), and contains aggressive liability shields. It is less transparent than a standard B2B agreement should be, as it strips creators of fundamental legal recourse that businesses typically retain.

1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet (for Businesses): You Cannot Sue Spotify in Court
Original Text: "Any dispute... arising out of or relating in any way to these Creator Terms... shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration... WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION."
Plain English Explanation: This is the most critical and predatory clause for an artist or creator. Just like with consumers, Spotify forbids you from suing them in a real court. You are also banned from joining with other artists in a class-action lawsuit to address widespread issues (like payment discrepancies or policy changes). This severely weakens the power of independent creators and forces them into a costly, private, individual arbitration process against a massive corporation.

2. The "Everything You Give Us is Ours" License: Sweeping Rights to Your Content and Ideas
Original Text: "You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public, publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content... If you provide ideas, suggestions, or other feedback... you grant Spotify an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to use the Feedback..."
Plain English Explanation: This is a two-pronged "God License." First, for any content you upload directly through the service (like a podcast episode, playlist art, or profile info), you grant Spotify a permanent, free, worldwide license to use and modify it. Second, and more aggressively, any idea or suggestion you provide becomes their property to use and profit from forever, without paying you or giving you credit.

3. The "We Own the Data" Clause: You Don't Own Your Audience Analytics
Original Text: "As between you and Spotify, Spotify owns all data that Spotify makes available to you through Spotify for Creators... You may only use the data... for your own internal informational purposes... You may not... authorize any third party to access or use the data for any purpose, including for advertising or ad-targeting, or to build a profile of any Spotify user."
Plain English Explanation: Spotify provides creators with analytics about their listeners. This clause makes it clear that you do not own this data. Spotify owns it. You are only allowed to view it for your own information. You are explicitly forbidden from exporting this data to use with other services, to sell to advertisers, or to build your own understanding of your audience outside of Spotify's platform. They control your access to your own listener data.

4. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Damages
Original Text: "IN NO EVENT WILL SPOTIFY, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES... BE LIABLE FOR (1) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (2) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT)..."
Plain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. If a failure by Spotify (like a technical glitch that makes your new album unavailable on release day, or a data error that misreports your streams) causes you to lose profits, business opportunities, or data, they will not be held legally or financially responsible for those "indirect" or "consequential" damages. This transfers enormous business risk from the platform to the creator.

5. The "As Is" Warranty Disclaimer: No Guarantee of a Functional Service
Original Text: "THE SPOTIFY SERVICE AND SPOTIFY FOR CREATORS ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE,' WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND... SPOTIFY AND ALL OWNERS OF CONTENT DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENT..."
Plain English Explanation: Spotify makes no legal promises that their creator tools will work correctly, be accurate, or be available when you need them. If their analytics are wrong, if their upload tools fail, or if their platform has security flaws, you have accepted that risk by agreeing to these terms.

6. The Shortened Time to Sue: One Year to File a Claim
Original Text: "You and Spotify agree that any arbitration shall be commenced within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period."
Plain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action. For any dispute, you must begin the arbitration process within one year of discovering the issue, or you permanently lose all rights to do so. This can be a significant hurdle for complex issues like long-term royalty accounting errors.

This analysis reveals a significant power imbalance, using consumer-style legal tactics against business partners (the creators) to limit their rights and Spotify's own accountability.
