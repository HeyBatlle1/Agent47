  const linkedinContent = `LinkedIn User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 25/100
Justification: While professionally formatted and clearly written, this agreement is fundamentally user-hostile in its core legal structure. It grants LinkedIn a sweeping, perpetual license to user content (which includes professional articles, posts, and resumes), completely disclaims all warranties, and severely limits its own liability. Most critically, it does not use forced arbitration, which is a major positive. However, it replaces it with a "home court" clause that is nearly as effective at preventing legal challenges. The low score reflects the vast power imbalance it creates in a professional context where users often have no alternative.

1. The "Everything You Post is Ours to Use" License: A Sweeping, Perpetual Right to Your Professional Content
Original Text: "You grant LinkedIn a worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process, information and content that you provide through our Services... without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others... This license is... perpetual and irrevocable."
Plain English Explanation: This is the foundational clause. Any content you post on LinkedIn‚Äîyour resume, articles you write, professional updates, comments‚Äîyou grant them a permanent, irreversible, free license to use, copy, modify, and distribute it. They can sell this data to others ("transferable and sublicensable") without ever paying you or asking for your permission again. You are providing the high-value professional content that powers their platform for free.

2. The "We Are Not Liable for Anything" Clause: A Total Disclaimer of Responsibility
Original Text: "LINKEDIN... DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR... LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, REVENUES OR REPUTATION..."
Plain English Explanation: This is an ironclad liability shield. If a failure by LinkedIn causes you to lose your entire professional network, critical data, or if a data breach harms your professional reputation and costs you a job, they are not legally or financially responsible for those damages. This transfers the entire professional risk of using their platform from them to you.

3. The "No Warranty" Disclaimer: The Service is Not Guaranteed to Work or Be Accurate
Original Text: "LINKEDIN... DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE... AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' BASIS."
Plain English Explanation: LinkedIn makes no legal promises that its service will work, be available, or that the information on it (including job postings or profiles) is accurate. They provide the platform with no guarantees. If you rely on their platform for your career and it fails or contains errors, you have accepted that risk.

4. The "Home Court Advantage" (Instead of Arbitration): You Must Sue in California or Ireland
Original Text: "For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live in the United States, you and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A... shall govern all claims... you and LinkedIn agree that all such claims can only be litigated in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA..."
Plain English Explanation: This is a critically important clause. LinkedIn does not use forced arbitration, which is a major point in their favor. However, they replace it with this "forum selection" clause. It forces any user in the US to file their lawsuit in Santa Clara County, California. For the vast majority of users, the cost and logistical difficulty of doing this is so high that it serves the same purpose as an arbitration clause: it effectively prevents most legal challenges.

5. Unilateral Control: They Can Change, Suspend, or End the Service at Any Time
Original Text: "We may change or discontinue any of our Services. We don't promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you've posted... LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law..."
Plain English Explanation: LinkedIn has the absolute right to change or shut down its services at any time. More importantly, they explicitly state they are not a storage service and have no obligation to save your data. If they decide to delete your content, your professional network, or your entire profile, this clause states they have the right to do so. You are responsible for keeping your own backups.

6. The Right to Terminate Your Account at Will
Original Text: "LinkedIn can end this Contract at any time. We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you are in breach of this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services..."
Plain English Explanation: This clause gives LinkedIn the right to terminate your professional online identity on their platform if they believe you have violated their rules. Given the importance of LinkedIn in many industries, this gives them significant power over a user's career prospects and professional network.

While the absence of a forced arbitration clause is a significant and positive distinction, the agreement is still built to give the platform maximum control and minimum liability, creating a substantial power imbalance with the professional user.
