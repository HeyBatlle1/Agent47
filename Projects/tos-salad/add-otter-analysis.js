  const otterContent = `Otter.ai Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 22/100
Justification: Otter.ai's Terms of Service are particularly concerning because they govern a service that records and processes private conversations, yet they employ aggressive legal protections that maximize corporate benefit while minimizing user rights. The agreement combines forced arbitration, mandatory AI training on conversation data, business email surveillance, and complete transcription accuracy disclaimers. The score reflects the heightened risk when sensitive conversation data is subject to standard tech industry exploitation practices without meaningful user protections.

1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet: You Forfeit Your Right to Sue
Original Text: "...you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND OTTER.AI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING."
Plain English Explanation: This is a complete waiver of your fundamental legal rights. You cannot sue Otter.ai in a real court before a judge or jury. You are also forbidden from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. You are forced into a private, individual arbitration process, which heavily favors the corporation.

2. The Mandatory AI Training Clause: Your Conversations Improve Their Product, Whether You Like It or Not
Original Text: "You acknowledge and agree that Otter.ai may collect, create, process, transmit, store, use, and disclose aggregated and/or deidentified data derived from Data or use of the Services ("Aggregated Data") for its business purposes, including for machine learning and training, industry analysis, benchmarking, and analytics."
Plain English Explanation: This clause gives Otter.ai the right to use data derived from your recorded conversations to train its machine learning models. While they state the data is "aggregated and/or deidentified," this is a mandatory opt-in. Unlike some competitors, they do not offer a clear way for individual users to opt-out of having their data used for these training purposes.

3. The Liability Cap: If They Fail, You Get $100
Original Text: "...THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE OTTER.AI ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO OTTER.AI FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR... OR (B) $100."
Plain English Explanation: This is the standard but predatory liability cap. If a failure by Otter.ai‚Äîsuch as a catastrophic data breach of your most confidential conversations‚Äîcauses you immense damage, the absolute maximum financial responsibility they accept is $100 or the fees you paid in the previous year.

4. The Accuracy Disclaimer: They Legally Guarantee Nothing About Their Core Product
Original Text: "OTTER.AI MAKES NO WARRANTY ABOUT THE COMPLETENESS OR ACCURACY OF THE TRANSCRIPTION... YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON AI OUTPUTS WITHOUT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMING THEIR ACCURACY."
Plain English Explanation: This is a critical disclaimer for a transcription service. Legally, Otter.ai makes zero promises that the transcriptions will be accurate. The entire responsibility for verifying the accuracy of the notes falls on you. You cannot hold them liable for damages caused by an inaccurate transcription.

5. The "Your Ideas Are Ours" Clause
Original Text: "If you choose to provide... ("Feedback"), then you hereby grant Otter.ai an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose..."
Plain English Explanation: Any idea or suggestion you provide to Otter.ai immediately becomes their property to use and profit from, forever, without any payment or credit to you.

6. The Business Email Trap: Your Work Email is Not Private
Original Text: "If the domain of the email address associated with your account is owned by an Organization... you acknowledge and agree that we may identify your account to the Organization, migrate your account to the Organization's account, and/or restrict or terminate access to your account."
Plain English Explanation: This is a severe warning. If you sign up for a personal Otter account using your work email address, Otter can report your account's existence to your employer and even forcibly merge it into your employer's corporate account, giving them potential access to your private recordings.

7. The Service Termination Clause: Your Conversations Can Disappear
Original Text: "Otter.ai may immediately terminate or suspend your access to the Service... at any time for any reason or no reason... Upon termination, your right to access and use the Service will cease immediately, and we may, without liability to you, delete your account and all related information and files."
Plain English Explanation: Otter.ai can delete your account and all of your recorded conversations at any time, for any reason or no reason at all. They explicitly state they have no liability to you for this deletion, meaning you could lose months or years of important meeting recordings permanently.

8. The Data Retention Ambiguity: No Clear Promise About When Your Data Gets Deleted
Original Text: "We may retain some or all of your Data for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. We may also retain and use your Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements."
Plain English Explanation: This clause gives Otter.ai broad discretion to keep your conversation data indefinitely for vague "commercially reasonable" purposes. There's no clear timeline for when your recordings and transcriptions will be permanently deleted from their systems.

9. The Third-Party Integration Risk Transfer
Original Text: "When you connect our Service to third-party platforms or services... any data shared with or accessed through those platforms is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms. Otter.ai is not responsible for how third parties handle your data."
Plain English Explanation: If you connect Otter.ai to other services (like Zoom, Slack, or Google Calendar), Otter.ai transfers all responsibility for data protection to those third parties. If one of those integrations leads to a data breach or misuse of your recordings, Otter.ai claims no liability.

This agreement applies standard tech industry exploitation practices to one of the most sensitive data types‚Äîprivate conversation recordings‚Äîcreating heightened privacy and security risks.
