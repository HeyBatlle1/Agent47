  const xContent = `X (Formerly Twitter) Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 14/100
Justification: X's Terms of Service represent one of the most aggressively exploitative agreements in social media, combining explicit AI training clauses, sweeping content licensing, and unprecedented financial penalties for data access. The agreement systematically strips users of legal recourse while maximizing corporate control over public discourse. The score reflects the platform's transformation into a data extraction and AI training operation that weaponizes user content while providing minimal user protections or accountability.

1. The AI Training Clause: Your Content is Explicitly AI Fuel
Original Text: "You agree that this license includes the right for us to... provide, promote, and improve the Services, including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type..."
Plain English Explanation: This is a direct and explicit statement that everything you post on X‚Äîyour thoughts, opinions, photos, and videos‚Äîcan and will be used to train their AI models. By using the service, you are providing the free raw material for the development of their future AI products.

2. The "Everything" License: A Sweeping, Perpetual Right to Your Content
Original Text: "By submitting, posting or displaying Content... you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, upload, download, and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or later developed, for any purpose."
Plain English Explanation: This is the standard, maximalist content license. It means you give X permanent, free rein to do almost anything they want with what you post. They can modify it, sell the rights to it to other companies ("sublicense"), and use it in any way they see fit to run and promote their service, without ever paying you.

3. The Liquidated Damages Clause: A Financial Penalty for Scraping
Original Text: "...if you violate the Terms... by requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts... in any 24-hour period - $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts. You agree that these amounts are (i) a reasonable estimate of our damages; (ii) not a penalty..."
Plain English Explanation: This is a highly unusual and aggressive clause. It pre-sets a massive financial penalty for users or automated systems that access too much data ("scraping"). It is designed to be a powerful deterrent against researchers, archivists, or competitors trying to analyze the platform's public data on a large scale.

4. The Standard $100 Liability Cap
Original Text: "IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE X ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM."
Plain English Explanation: If X's failure causes you catastrophic harm (e.g., a massive data breach, loss of your business's account), the absolute maximum financial responsibility they accept is $100 or the fees you paid them in the last six months.

5. The Shortened Time to Sue: One Year or Your Rights Are Gone
Original Text: "You and X agree that you must initiate any proceeding or action within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event... Otherwise... you forever waive the right to pursue any claim..."
Plain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action. You are forced to file any lawsuit within one year of the incident, or your right to do so is permanently lost.

6. The Home Court Advantage: You Must Sue in Texas
Original Text: "All disputes related to these Terms or the Services... will be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas..."
Plain English Explanation: This forces any user with a legal dispute to file their lawsuit in Texas, regardless of where they live. This creates a significant financial and logistical barrier to seeking justice for most people.

X's Terms of Service transform public discourse into proprietary AI training data while systematically eliminating user rights and legal recourse through extreme liability limitations and access barriers.
