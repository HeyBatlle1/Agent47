  const googleContent = `Google Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 20/100
Justification: Google's Terms of Service establish a comprehensive framework that grants the company extensive rights to user content while simultaneously limiting liability to the maximum extent possible. The agreement combines sweeping content licensing, automated surveillance, aggressive liability caps, and unilateral service control. Most critically, it applies these exploitative practices across the foundational services that billions depend on daily (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Search). The score reflects systematic data extraction and control mechanisms designed to maximize corporate benefit while minimizing user rights and protections.

1. The "Everything" License: A Sweeping, Perpetual Right to All Your Content
Original Text: "When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content."
Plain English Explanation: This is the core of the agreement. You grant Google a permanent, worldwide, free license to do almost anything with the content you create or store on their services (Gmail, Drive, Photos, etc.). While this is necessary for them to provide services (e.g., to show you a photo or translate a document), the license is incredibly broad. It allows them to modify your content, create new works from it, and publicly display it, all for the purpose of operating and improving their services.

2. The Automated Content Scanner: Your Data is Constantly Analyzed
Original Text: "Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored ads, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored."
Plain English Explanation: This clause explicitly confirms the core of Google's business model. All of your content—including the text of your private emails, your documents in Drive, and your photos—is constantly scanned by their AI systems. This is done to detect spam, but also to build a detailed profile of you to personalize your search results and, most importantly, to show you highly targeted advertisements.

3. The Aggressive Liability Cap: If Google Causes Catastrophic Loss, They Owe You Nothing (or a Free Month)
Original Text: "WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, GOOGLE... WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ...THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GOOGLE... FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS... IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN)."
Plain English Explanation: This is Google's primary liability shield. If a failure on their part (like a major security breach or a server failure that deletes all your data in Google Drive) causes you to lose your business, your life's work, or irreplaceable family photos, they will not be responsible for your financial losses. Their total liability is capped at the amount you paid them for the service (which is often $0), or they can choose to simply give you another month of the service for free.

4. Total Warranty Disclaimer: They Legally Promise You Nothing
Original Text: "OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES 'AS IS'."
Plain English Explanation: This clause removes any legal guarantee about the quality or reliability of Google's services. They make no promises that their services will work, be available when you need them, or be reliable. By using their products, you accept all the risk of their potential failure, including the risk of losing your data.

5. Unilateral Control: They Can Change, Limit, or Terminate Services at Will
Original Text: "We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. You can stop using our Services at any time... Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time."
Plain English Explanation: This states that Google has the absolute right to change, limit, or even completely shut down any of its services at any time. Your access is not guaranteed. They can impose new limits (like storage caps) or terminate your access to a service you rely on, and your only choice is to stop using it.

6. The Business Risk Transfer: If You Use Google for Business, All Risk is Yours
Original Text: "If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees."
Plain English Explanation: This is a critical clause for any business, small or large, that uses Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, etc.). It means that if Google is sued because of something your business or an employee did, your business is legally required to pay for all of Google's legal defense costs, including their lawyers' fees and any financial damages awarded. This transfers the entire legal and financial risk of using their platform from Google to your business.

7. Your Ideas Become Theirs, Without Credit or Payment
Original Text: "If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you."
Plain English Explanation: This clause states that any idea, suggestion, or piece of feedback you provide to Google can be used by them for any purpose, including developing new products and features. They have no obligation to pay you, give you credit, or even acknowledge that the idea was yours. Your intellectual contribution is effectively a free gift to them.

8. The Unilateral Contract Update: They Change the Rules, You Must Accept or Leave
Original Text: "We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly... If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service."
Plain English Explanation: Google can change this legal contract at any time. The responsibility is on you to constantly check for updates. If they introduce a new rule you disagree with (for example, a new data collection policy), your only option is to stop using the service and abandon your account and data. Continued use equals legal acceptance of the new terms.

9. The "No Waiver" Clause: Their Forgiveness is Not a Precedent
Original Text: "If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future)."
Plain English Explanation: This is a subtle but important legal protection for Google. It means that if you violate a rule and they don't enforce it immediately, it does not mean they have forgiven the violation. They reserve the right to punish you for that same violation at any point in the future. It prevents you from ever claiming "but you let me do it before."

10. The Governing Law Clause: Forcing You into Their Home Court
Original Text: "The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A..."
Plain English Explanation: If you have a legal dispute with Google, this clause forces you to file your lawsuit in their home territory of Santa Clara County, California. This creates a massive financial and logistical barrier for the vast majority of users around the world, making it practically impossible for most people to seek justice in court.

11. Third-Party Content Disclaimer: They Are Not Responsible for What You See
Original Text: "Our Services display some content that is not Google's. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies... but we do not necessarily review content, so please don't assume that we do."
Plain English Explanation: This is a liability shield for services like YouTube, Blogger, and search results. Google states that they are not responsible for the content created by others on their platforms. While they have the right to review and remove content, they explicitly state they have no legal obligation to do so. This places the burden on users to navigate potentially harmful, false, or illegal content.

The Google Terms of Service establish a comprehensive framework of content licensing and surveillance that maximizes corporate benefit while minimizing user rights across foundational internet services.
