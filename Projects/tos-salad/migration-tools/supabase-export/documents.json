Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using GitHub.

Definitions\n\nShort version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.\n\nAn \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.\nThe “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.\n\"Beta Previews\" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.\n“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own.\n“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.\nThe “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.\n“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).\nThe “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as electronjs.org. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.\nB. Account Terms\n\nShort version: Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.\n\n1. Account Controls\n\nUsers. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.\n\nOrganizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.\n\n2. Required Information\n\nYou must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.\n\n3. Account Requirements\n\nWe have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.\n\nYou must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:\nA machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.\nOne person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).\nYou must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.\nYour login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.\nYou may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our Export Controls policy.\n4. Account Security\n\nYou are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.\n\nYou are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.\nYou will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the GitHub Support portal if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.\n5. Additional Terms\n\nIn some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.\n\nIf you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\n\nIf you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\n\nC. Acceptable Use\n\nShort version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.\n\nYour use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.\n\nYou agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.\n\nD. User-Generated Content\n\nShort version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.\n\n1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content\n\nYou may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.\n\n2. GitHub May Remove Content\n\nWe have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.\n\n3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants\n\nYou retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.\n\nBecause you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.\n\n4. License Grant to Us\n\nWe need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.\n\nThis license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.\n\n5. License Grant to Other Users\n\nAny User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).\n\nIf you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.\n\n6. Contributions Under Repository License\n\nWhenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.\n\nIsn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We're just making it explicit.\n\n7. Moral Rights\n\nYou retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.\n\nTo the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.\n\nE. Private Repositories\n\nShort version: We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.\n\n1. Control of Private Repositories\n\nSome Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.\n\n2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories\n\nGitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.\n\n3. Access\n\nGitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.\n\nYou may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:\n\nYou may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.\n\nAdditionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.\n\nGitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.\n\nF. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy\n\nIf you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.\n\nWe will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.\n\nG. Intellectual Property Notice\n\nShort version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.\n\n1. GitHub's Rights to Content\n\nGitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.\n\n2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos\n\nIf you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.\n\n3. License to GitHub Policies\n\nThis Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.\n\nH. API Terms\n\nShort version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.\n\nAbuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.\n\nYou may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.\n\nYou may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\n\nAll use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n\nGitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.\n\nI. GitHub Additional Product Terms\n\nShort version: You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.\n\nSome Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.\n\nJ. Beta Previews\n\nShort version: Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.\n\n1. Subject to Change\n\nBeta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.\n\n2. Confidentiality\n\nAs a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.\n\nConfidentiality Obligations. You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).\n\nExceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.\n\n3. Feedback\n\nWe’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.\n\nK. Payment\n\nShort version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.\n\n1. Pricing\n\nOur pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.\n\n2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes\nWe will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.\nIf you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.\nIf you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.\nYou may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.\n3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds\n\nPayment Based on Plan For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.\n\nPayment Based on Usage Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details.\n\nInvoicing For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.\n\n4. Authorization\n\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.\n\n5. Responsibility for Payment\n\nYou are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the GitHub Support portal. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.\n\nL. Cancellation and Termination\n\nShort version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.\n\n1. Account Cancellation\n\nIt is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.\n\n2. Upon Cancellation\n\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.\n\nWe will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.\n\nUpon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.\n\n3. GitHub May Terminate\n\nGitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.\n\n4. Survival\n\nAll provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.\n\nM. Communications with GitHub\n\nShort version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.\n\n1. Electronic Communication Required\n\nFor contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.\n\n2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing\n\nCommunications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.\n\n3. No Phone Support\n\nGitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.\n\nN. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\nShort version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.\n\nGitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.\n\nGitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.\n\nO. Limitation of Liability\n\nShort version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.\n\nYou understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from\n\nthe use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;\nyour use or inability to use the Service;\nany modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;\nthe Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;\nunauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;\nstatements or conduct of any third party on the Service;\nany other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or\nany other matter relating to the Service.\n\nOur liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.\n\nP. Release and Indemnification\n\nShort version: You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.\n\nIf you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\n\nYou agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.\n\nQ.

Miscellaneous Please see this section for legal details including our choice of law. The GitHub Terms of Service Effective date: November 16, 2020 A. Definitions Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information. An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy. \"Beta Previews\" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms). The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as electronjs.org. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. B. Account Terms Short version: Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure. 1. Account Controls Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it. Organizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization. 2. Required Information You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes. 3. Account Requirements We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service. You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts: A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account. One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws. Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows. You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our Export Controls policy. 4. Account Security You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the GitHub Support portal if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account. 5. Additional Terms In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. C. Acceptable Use Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other. Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations. You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines. D. User-Generated Content Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to. 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content. 2. GitHub May Remove Content We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms. 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post. Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it. 4. License Grant to Us We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program. 5. License Grant to Other Users Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control). If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users. 6. Contributions Under Repository License Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede. Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We're just making it explicit. 7. Moral Rights You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. E. Private Repositories Short version: We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent. 1. Control of Private Repositories Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content. 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. 3. Access GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement. You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example: You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories. GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security. F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy. G. Intellectual Property Notice Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed. 1. GitHub's Rights to Content GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub. 2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos. 3. License to GitHub Policies This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository. H. API Terms Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension. You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations. You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement. GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service. I. GitHub Additional Product Terms Short version: You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement. Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the GitHub Additional Product Terms. J. Beta Previews Short version: Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better. 1. Subject to Change Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk. 2. Confidentiality As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret. Confidentiality Obligations. You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature). Exceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law. 3. Feedback We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation. K. Payment Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change. 1. Pricing Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term. 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date. If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately. You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content. 3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds Payment Based on Plan For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made. Payment Based on Usage Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details. Invoicing For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement. 4. Authorization By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub. 5. Responsibility for Payment You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the GitHub Support portal. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information. L. Cancellation and Termination Short version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly. 1. Account Cancellation It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request. 2. Upon Cancellation We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled. We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked. Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade. 3. GitHub May Terminate GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. 4. Survival All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability. M. Communications with GitHub Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users. 1. Electronic Communication Required For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights. 2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent. 3. No Phone Support GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support. N. Disclaimer of Warranties Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect. GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service. O. Limitation of Liability Short version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you. You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content; your use or inability to use the Service; any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service; the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available; unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service. Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control. P. Release and Indemnification Short version: You are responsible for your use of the service.

    "raw_content": "Google Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 20/100\nJustification: Google's Terms of Service establish a comprehensive framework that grants the company extensive rights to user content while simultaneously limiting liability to the maximum extent possible. The agreement combines sweeping content licensing, automated surveillance, aggressive liability caps, and unilateral service control. Most critically, it applies these exploitative practices across the foundational services that billions depend on daily (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Search). The score reflects systematic data extraction and control mechanisms designed to maximize corporate benefit while minimizing user rights and protections.\n\n1. The \"Everything\" License: A Sweeping, Perpetual Right to All Your Content\nOriginal Text: \"When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the core of the agreement. You grant Google a permanent, worldwide, free license to do almost anything with the content you create or store on their services (Gmail, Drive, Photos, etc.). While this is necessary for them to provide services (e.g., to show you a photo or translate a document), the license is incredibly broad. It allows them to modify your content, create new works from it, and publicly display it, all for the purpose of operating and improving their services.\n\n2. The Automated Content Scanner: Your Data is Constantly Analyzed\nOriginal Text: \"Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored ads, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause explicitly confirms the core of Google's business model. All of your content—including the text of your private emails, your documents in Drive, and your photos—is constantly scanned by their AI systems. This is done to detect spam, but also to build a detailed profile of you to personalize your search results and, most importantly, to show you highly targeted advertisements.\n\n3. The Aggressive Liability Cap: If Google Causes Catastrophic Loss, They Owe You Nothing (or a Free Month)\nOriginal Text: \"WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, GOOGLE... WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ...THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GOOGLE... FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS... IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is Google's primary liability shield. If a failure on their part (like a major security breach or a server failure that deletes all your data in Google Drive) causes you to lose your business, your life's work, or irreplaceable family photos, they will not be responsible for your financial losses. Their total liability is capped at the amount you paid them for the service (which is often $0), or they can choose to simply give you another month of the service for free.\n\n4. Total Warranty Disclaimer: They Legally Promise You Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES 'AS IS'.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause removes any legal guarantee about the quality or reliability of Google's services. They make no promises that their services will work, be available when you need them, or be reliable. By using their products, you accept all the risk of their potential failure, including the risk of losing your data.\n\n5. Unilateral Control: They Can Change, Limit, or Terminate Services at Will\nOriginal Text: \"We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. You can stop using our Services at any time... Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This states that Google has the absolute right to change, limit, or even completely shut down any of its services at any time. Your access is not guaranteed. They can impose new limits (like storage caps) or terminate your access to a service you rely on, and your only choice is to stop using it.\n\n6. The Business Risk Transfer: If You Use Google for Business, All Risk is Yours\nOriginal Text: \"If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical clause for any business, small or large, that uses Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, etc.). It means that if Google is sued because of something your business or an employee did, your business is legally required to pay for all of Google's legal defense costs, including their lawyers' fees and any financial damages awarded. This transfers the entire legal and financial risk of using their platform from Google to your business.\n\n7. Your Ideas Become Theirs, Without Credit or Payment\nOriginal Text: \"If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause states that any idea, suggestion, or piece of feedback you provide to Google can be used by them for any purpose, including developing new products and features. They have no obligation to pay you, give you credit, or even acknowledge that the idea was yours. Your intellectual contribution is effectively a free gift to them.\n\n8. The Unilateral Contract Update: They Change the Rules, You Must Accept or Leave\nOriginal Text: \"We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly... If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Google can change this legal contract at any time. The responsibility is on you to constantly check for updates. If they introduce a new rule you disagree with (for example, a new data collection policy), your only option is to stop using the service and abandon your account and data. Continued use equals legal acceptance of the new terms.\n\n9. The \"No Waiver\" Clause: Their Forgiveness is Not a Precedent\nOriginal Text: \"If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a subtle but important legal protection for Google. It means that if you violate a rule and they don't enforce it immediately, it does not mean they have forgiven the violation. They reserve the right to punish you for that same violation at any point in the future. It prevents you from ever claiming \"but you let me do it before.\"\n\n10. The Governing Law Clause: Forcing You into Their Home Court\nOriginal Text: \"The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A...\"\nPlain English Explanation: If you have a legal dispute with Google, this clause forces you to file your lawsuit in their home territory of Santa Clara County, California. This creates a massive financial and logistical barrier for the vast majority of users around the world, making it practically impossible for most people to seek justice in court.\n\n11. Third-Party Content Disclaimer: They Are Not Responsible for What You See\nOriginal Text: \"Our Services display some content that is not Google's. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies... but we do not necessarily review content, so please don't assume that we do.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a liability shield for services like YouTube, Blogger, and search results. Google states that they are not responsible for the content created by others on their platforms. While they have the right to review and remove content, they explicitly state they have no legal obligation to do so. This places the burden on users to navigate potentially harmful, false, or illegal content.\n\nThe Google Terms of Service establish a comprehensive framework of content licensing and surveillance that maximizes corporate benefit while minimizing user rights across foundational internet services.\n\nTransparency Score: 20/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 11 systematic content control and surveillance mechanisms",

    "url": "https://openai.com/terms",
    "raw_content": "OpenAI Terms of Use: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 30/100\nJustification: While structured more clearly than older \"horror movie\" ToS documents, this agreement is a masterclass in transferring immense risk and responsibility from the corporation to the individual user. It grants ownership of AI output with one hand while securing a sweeping license to use all user data for AI training with the other. The indemnification clause is one of the most aggressive in the industry, making the user legally responsible for the AI's failures. Combined with standard user-hostile clauses like forced arbitration and a severe liability cap, this document creates a profound power imbalance, especially given the novel and unpredictable nature of the technology.\n\n1. The Great Trade-Off: You \"Own\" the Output, but They Use Everything to Train the AI\nOriginal Text: \"To the extent permitted by law, you own all Input... OpenAI hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output... You agree that we have the right to use Content to provide, maintain, develop and improve our Services... This may include storing your Content in a way that helps us to improve the safety of our Services. We may also use Content you provide to us to develop and improve our Services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the central, critical deal you make with OpenAI. They grant you legal ownership of the text and images the AI generates for you (\"Output\"). However, in exchange, you grant them the right to use everything—your prompts (\"Input\") and the AI's responses (\"Output\")—to train, develop, and improve their future AI models. While they may offer an opt-out for some services, the default agreement is that your interactions are the free raw material for their next generation of products.\n\n2. The Ultimate Risk Transfer: You are Legally Responsible for the AI's Mistakes\nOriginal Text: \"You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your subsequent use of content generated by the Services... and your breach of these Terms...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is arguably the most predatory and important clause in the entire document. It means that if you use something ChatGPT generates and it gets you sued (for example, it generates defamatory text, copyrighted code, or dangerously incorrect advice), you are legally required to pay for OpenAI's lawyers and all associated costs. You, the user, are held 100% responsible for the failures and flaws of their product. This is a complete transfer of legal and financial risk from the creator of the technology to the user.\n\n3. The Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Stripping Your Legal Rights\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND OPENAI AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US... THROUGH BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION... YOU AND OPENAI WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE RESOLVED IN COURT... YOU AND OPENAI AGREE THAT EACH OF US CAN ONLY BRING A CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER OF US CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause forbids you from suing OpenAI in a real court and bans you from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. This is especially dangerous for AI, where systemic issues like widespread bias, security flaws, or harmful outputs could affect millions of users at once. This clause ensures those systemic problems cannot be challenged collectively, drastically reducing consumer power and corporate accountability.\n\n4. The \"AI is Unreliable\" Disclaimer: They Legally Guarantee Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study... Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You must evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is both an honest warning and a legal shield. OpenAI explicitly states that their AI can be wrong, make things up, and be completely inaccurate. By using the service, you legally agree that the entire burden of fact-checking and verifying the AI's output is on you. You cannot hold them responsible for any damages caused by acting on false or flawed information generated by their product.\n\n5. The Aggressive Liability Cap: The Standard $100 Limit\nOriginal Text: \"Our aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed the greater of the amount you paid for the Service... in the 12 months before the liability arose or one hundred dollars ($100).\"\nPlain English Explanation: Even in a situation where OpenAI is found to be legally liable for causing you harm, this clause caps their total financial responsibility at a maximum of $100 for free users. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for even the most catastrophic failures.\n\n6. The High-Risk Activity Ban: A Further Transfer of Responsibility\nOriginal Text: \"You must not use our Services for activities that have high risk of physical harm, including... weapons development; military and warfare... You must not use our Services for activities that have high risk of economic harm, including... providing tailored financial advice to individuals without a qualified person reviewing the information.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause forbids you from using their AI for high-stakes activities. While this appears to be a safety measure, it also functions as a powerful legal defense for them. If someone uses their AI to make a disastrous financial decision or for a dangerous purpose, OpenAI can point to this clause and argue that the user was violating the terms, further shifting all blame and responsibility away from the company and onto the individual.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a blueprint for a new kind of power imbalance, one where users are granted phenomenal creative tools but are simultaneously stripped of legal recourse and burdened with the full legal and financial liability for the tool's unpredictable and potentially flawed outputs.\n\nTransparency Score: 30/100 - High Risk Level\nRed Flags: 6 systematic AI risk transfer and user exploitation issues",

We may also use Content you provide to us to develop and improve our Services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the central, critical deal you make with OpenAI. They grant you legal ownership of the text and images the AI generates for you (\"Output\"). However, in exchange, you grant them the right to use everything—your prompts (\"Input\") and the AI's responses (\"Output\")—to train, develop, and improve their future AI models. While they may offer an opt-out for some services, the default agreement is that your interactions are the free raw material for their next generation of products.\n\n2. The Ultimate Risk Transfer: You are Legally Responsible for the AI's Mistakes\nOriginal Text: \"You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your subsequent use of content generated by the Services... and your breach of these Terms...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is arguably the most predatory and important clause in the entire document. It means that if you use something ChatGPT generates and it gets you sued (for example, it generates defamatory text, copyrighted code, or dangerously incorrect advice), you are legally required to pay for OpenAI's lawyers and all associated costs. You, the user, are held 100% responsible for the failures and flaws of their product. This is a complete transfer of legal and financial risk from the creator of the technology to the user.\n\n3. The Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Stripping Your Legal Rights\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND OPENAI AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US... THROUGH BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION... YOU AND OPENAI WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE RESOLVED IN COURT... YOU AND OPENAI AGREE THAT EACH OF US CAN ONLY BRING A CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER OF US CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause forbids you from suing OpenAI in a real court and bans you from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. This is especially dangerous for AI, where systemic issues like widespread bias, security flaws, or harmful outputs could affect millions of users at once. This clause ensures those systemic problems cannot be challenged collectively, drastically reducing consumer power and corporate accountability.\n\n4. The \"AI is Unreliable\" Disclaimer: They Legally Guarantee Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study... Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You must evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is both an honest warning and a legal shield. OpenAI explicitly states that their AI can be wrong, make things up, and be completely inaccurate. By using the service, you legally agree that the entire burden of fact-checking and verifying the AI's output is on you. You cannot hold them responsible for any damages caused by acting on false or flawed information generated by their product.\n\n5. The Aggressive Liability Cap: The Standard $100 Limit\nOriginal Text: \"Our aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed the greater of the amount you paid for the Service... in the 12 months before the liability arose or one hundred dollars ($100).\"\nPlain English Explanation: Even in a situation where OpenAI is found to be legally liable for causing you harm, this clause caps their total financial responsibility at a maximum of $100 for free users. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for even the most catastrophic failures.\n\n6. The High-Risk Activity Ban: A Further Transfer of Responsibility\nOriginal Text: \"You must not use our Services for activities that have high risk of physical harm, including... weapons development; military and warfare... You must not use our Services for activities that have high risk of economic harm, including... providing tailored financial advice to individuals without a qualified person reviewing the information.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause forbids you from using their AI for high-stakes activities. While this appears to be a safety measure, it also functions as a powerful legal defense for them. If someone uses their AI to make a disastrous financial decision or for a dangerous purpose, OpenAI can point to this clause and argue that the user was violating the terms, further shifting all blame and responsibility away from the company and onto the individual.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a blueprint for a new kind of power imbalance, one where users are granted phenomenal creative tools but are simultaneously stripped of legal recourse and burdened with the full legal and financial liability for the tool's unpredictable and potentially flawed outputs.\n\nTransparency Score: 30/100 - High Risk Level\nRed Flags: 6 systematic AI risk transfer and user exploitation issues",

    "url": "https://discord.com/terms",
    "raw_content": "Discord Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 20/100\nJustification: This agreement combines the worst of all worlds. It uses the standard user-hostile clauses found in most tech ToS (forced arbitration, class action waiver, severe liability caps). But it compounds this by offloading the most critical and labor-intensive function of a communication platform—moderation—onto its users, creating a permissive environment for abuse while legally shielding itself from the consequences. The document is not transparent about the true scale of this user-borne responsibility.\n\nThe central paradox of Discord is that the very features that make it a haven for gaming communities, friend groups, and hobbyists—privacy, user control, and decentralized moderation—are the exact same features that, when left unchecked, can make it the ideal command-and-control center for extremist groups. The Terms of Service is the legal architecture that enables this paradox.\n\nThe Moderation Vacuum: The ToS places the primary responsibility for moderation on unpaid, volunteer server owners and their appointed moderators. Discord's global Trust & Safety team acts as a secondary, reactive force, typically only intervening when something is reported or becomes a major public incident. This creates a \"moderation vacuum\" where extremist groups can operate freely in unmonitored or sympathetically moderated servers.\n\nThe Illusion of Absolute Privacy: While Discord is not end-to-end encrypted by default, its branding and user experience create a strong perception of privacy. This encourages sensitive or illicit conversations that users might not have on more public-facing platforms. The legal right for Discord to access and review content is buried in the terms, creating a gap between user perception and legal reality that extremist groups exploit.\n\nThe Architecture of Isolation (Echo Chambers): The server-based model is, by its nature, an architecture for creating isolated communities. The legal framework fully enables the creation of these private, invite-only spaces. For extremist groups, this is the perfect digital environment to radicalize members, plan activities, and reinforce a shared ideology without exposure to outside viewpoints.\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: The Ultimate Accountability Shield\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND DISCORD AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION... YOU AND DISCORD WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE RESOLVED IN COURT... YOU AND DISCORD WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the cornerstone of their legal defense. You cannot sue Discord in a real court. You cannot join with other users to hold them accountable for widespread problems (like platform-wide negligence in handling extremist content). You are forced into a private, individual arbitration process that is expensive, difficult, and designed to protect the corporation from systemic challenges.\n\n2. The Moderation Responsibility Dump: It's Your Job, Not Ours\nOriginal Text: \"Server owners and administrators are responsible for their servers... You are responsible for the content that you post to the service and the consequences of posting it... We are not responsible for it.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most critical clause in the context of extremist activity. Discord legally and officially places the primary burden of content moderation on its volunteer users. They provide the tools, but you are responsible for the 24/7 job of monitoring for hate speech, illegal content, and violent threats. This clause allows harmful content to flourish in poorly-moderated or complicitly-moderated servers while legally absolving Discord of primary responsibility.\n\n3. The \"Everything You Post is Ours to Use\" License\nOriginal Text: \"By uploading or sharing content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display your content...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the standard, sweeping content license. You grant Discord a permanent, free, worldwide right to do almost anything with the content you post on their platform. While necessary for them to operate the service, this license is incredibly broad and gives them extensive rights over your creations without any payment to you.\n\n4. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Any Damages\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT WILL DISCORD OR OUR AFFILIATES... BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES... WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF ANY USER OR FOR 'USER CONTENT'...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer. If you suffer harm because of content you were exposed to on Discord (e.g., threats, harassment, illegal material), or if a data breach exposes your private conversations, this clause states that they are not legally or financially responsible for the damages. They explicitly state they are not responsible for what their users do or say.\n\n5. The Liability Cap: The Standard $100 Limit\nOriginal Text: \"The total aggregate liability of Discord... for all claims... will not exceed the greater of one hundred U.S. dollars ($100) or the amount you have paid us in the twelve months prior...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Even in a situation where they are found liable, this clause caps their total financial responsibility at a maximum of $100 for free users. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for even catastrophic failures.\n\n6. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: No Guarantee of a Functional or Safe Service\nOriginal Text: \"WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES... INCLUDING... THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Discord makes no legal promises that its service will work, be secure, or be safe. They do not guarantee the platform is free from errors or harmful content. By using the service, you legally accept 100% of the risk associated with its potential failures and the content you may encounter.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a textbook example of a legal framework that creates maximum operational flexibility for the company and maximum risk and responsibility for the user.

    "url": "https://paypal.com/terms-of-service",
    "raw_content": "PayPal User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 10/100\nJustification: This document is a labyrinth of user-hostile clauses. It is long, complex, and contains one of the most aggressive forced arbitration and class action waiver clauses in the industry. It grants PayPal sweeping rights to unilaterally alter the agreement, place indefinite holds on user funds with little recourse, and aggressively limit its own liability for failures. The power imbalance is extreme, and the document does little to present its most critical terms in a way that an average user could easily understand.\n\n1. The Ironclad Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: You Cannot Sue Them. Ever.\nOriginal Text: \"If you... bring a claim against PayPal in court, PayPal can require you to arbitrate... You and PayPal each waive any right to a jury trial and to bring or participate in any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative action.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the cornerstone of their legal armor and the most important clause in the document. You are permanently forbidden from suing PayPal in a real court of law. You are also explicitly banned from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit to address widespread problems (like a security breach, systemic account freezes, or unfair fee changes). You are forced into a private, individual arbitration process that is designed to protect the corporation from any systemic legal challenge.\n\n2. The Power to Seize Your Money: Holds, Limitations, and Reserves\nOriginal Text: \"We may, in our discretion, place a hold on payments you receive... We may place a limitation on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with you... We may also require you to maintain a reserve of funds in your PayPal account to cover potential liability.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This series of clauses gives PayPal the absolute right, at its \"discretion,\" to freeze the money in your account. They can do this for a variety of risk-related reasons that they define. They can prevent you from withdrawing or sending your money (\"limitation\") or even require you to keep a certain amount of your own money locked in your account as a security deposit (\"reserve\"). This gives them immense power over your funds with limited immediate recourse for you.\n\n3. The Absolute Disclaimer of Liability: If They Fail, It's Not Their Problem\nOriginal Text: \"The PayPal services are provided 'as-is' and without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory... PayPal... will not have any liability for any failure or unavailability of the PayPal services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. PayPal makes no legal promises that its service will work, be available, or be secure. If their service goes down during a critical transaction, if a glitch causes you to lose money, or if their platform has a security failure, this clause is designed to ensure they cannot be held legally or financially responsible for the consequences.\n\n4. Your Responsibility for Their Losses: The Aggressive Indemnification Clause\nOriginal Text: \"You must indemnify PayPal for actions we take to protect your PayPal account and business. You will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim or demand (including reasonable legal fees) made or incurred by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user agreement...\"\nPlain English Explanation: If PayPal gets sued or faces costs because of something you did—even actions they take \"to protect your account\"—you are legally required to pay for their legal fees and any damages. This transfers a massive amount of financial and legal risk from the corporation to you, the user.\n\n5. The \"No Waiver\" Clause: Their Inaction Doesn't Mean Forgiveness\nOriginal Text: \"Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a crucial legal protection for them. If you violate a rule and they don't immediately penalize you (for example, by freezing your account), it does not mean they have forgiven the violation. They reserve the right to punish you for that same violation at any point in the future.\n\n6. The Unilateral \"Changes\" Clause: They Can Change the Contract at Any Time\nOriginal Text: \"We may revise this user agreement... from time to time. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it... If you do not agree to the revised user agreement, you must terminate your use of the PayPal services...\"\nPlain English Explanation: PayPal can change this entire legal contract whenever they want. Your only options are to accept the new rules by continuing to use the service or to close your account. You have no power to negotiate, and the terms you originally agreed to are never permanent.\n\n7. The \"Communications\" Clause: You Agree to Be Contacted, Including by Autodialer\nOriginal Text: \"You consent to receive autodialed and prerecorded message calls and text messages from PayPal... We may share your phone numbers with our service providers... who we have contracted with to assist us in pursuing our rights or performing our obligations under this user agreement...\"\nPlain English Explanation: By signing up, you legally consent to receiving automated calls and text messages from PayPal and their debt collectors or other partners. This provides them with a broad license to contact you using methods that are often restricted by law, unless prior consent is given.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a fortress of legal clauses designed to grant the company maximum control over user funds and minimum accountability for its own failures, all built on the foundation of stripping users of their right to sue.\n\nTransparency Score: 10/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 7 systematic financial exploitation and user rights elimination issues",

The score reflects the platform's transformation of creative expression into surveillance capitalism while transferring all legal and financial risks to individual creators.\n\n1. The Double License: Giving Rights to YouTube AND Every Other User\nOriginal Text: \"License to YouTube: By providing Content... you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content... License to Other Users: You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content... only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a crucial distinction. You are not just giving a license to YouTube. You are simultaneously giving a separate license to every single user on the planet to watch and interact with your video through YouTube's features. This is the legal foundation that makes the entire platform work.\n\n2. The Right to Monetize: YouTube Can Put Ads on Your Video and Keep the Money\nOriginal Text: \"You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause explicitly gives YouTube the right to run ads on or next to your videos and collect all the revenue from those ads. Unless you are a member of the separate YouTube Partner Program, you are not entitled to any of that money. You provide the content, they keep the profits.\n\n3. The Liability Cap: The Infamous $500 Limit\nOriginal Text: \"YOUTUBE AND ITS AFFILIATES' TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT YOUTUBE HAS PAID TO YOU FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE DATE OF YOUR NOTICE... OF THE CLAIM; AND (B) USD $500.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is YouTube's version of the liability cap. If you are a regular user who doesn't earn money from the platform, their maximum liability to you for any harm they cause is $500. This is higher than most other platforms' $100 cap but is still a trivial amount compared to potential damages.\n\n4. Full Indemnification: You Pay Their Legal Bills\nOriginal Text: \"To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its Affiliates... from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from... your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical clause for creators. If you use a clip of a movie or a song in your video and the copyright owner sues YouTube, this clause means you are legally obligated to pay for YouTube's lawyers and all associated costs. It transfers the entire risk of copyright infringement from the platform to the creator.\n\n5. Automated Content Scanning and the \"Strike\" System\nOriginal Text: \"We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse... YouTube operates a system of \"strikes\" in respect of Content that violates the YouTube Community Guidelines. Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes their enforcement mechanism. Your videos are constantly scanned by AI to detect violations. If a violation is found, you are issued a \"strike.\" Accumulating strikes can lead to restrictions and the permanent deletion of your channel and all of its content. This automated system is often criticized for its errors, but it is the core of their content moderation.\n\n6. Service Termination and Content Loss\nOriginal Text: \"YouTube may terminate your access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately... Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms of Service will also terminate and you must immediately cease all use of the Service.\"\nPlain English Explanation: YouTube can delete your channel and years of creative work at any time, for any reason or no reason at all. All the time, effort, and creativity you invested in building your channel can be permanently destroyed with no recourse and no compensation.\n\n7. Content Ownership vs. Platform Control\nOriginal Text: \"You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to YouTube, you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license...\"\nPlain English Explanation: While you technically \"own\" your content, YouTube's license is so broad that this ownership becomes practically meaningless. They can use, modify, and distribute your content in any way they see fit, and even transfer these rights to other companies, all without paying you unless you're in their partner program.\n\nYouTube's Terms of Service create a systematic exploitation of creative labor where creators bear all legal and financial risks while the platform extracts maximum advertising value from their unpaid content creation.\n\nTransparency Score: 18/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 7 creator exploitation and legal liability transfer mechanisms",

    "raw_content": "Microsoft Services Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 16/100\nJustification: Microsoft's Services Agreement represents a comprehensive system of legal control that systematically removes user rights while maximizing corporate protection. The agreement combines forced arbitration with mass filing restrictions, extreme liability caps ($10 maximum), complete warranty disclaimers, and unilateral account termination powers. Most critically, it includes sophisticated \"kill switches\" for organized consumer action and transfers intellectual property rights for free. The score reflects systematic user subjugation through advanced legal engineering designed to prevent accountability.\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet: You Forfeit Your Right to a Day in Court\nOriginal Text: \"If we can't, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. ... Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions... aren't allowed.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is arguably the most significant clause. It states that you cannot sue Microsoft in a traditional court. Instead, you are forced into a private arbitration system. Crucially, it bans you from joining with other people who have the same problem (a class action lawsuit). This drastically reduces consumer power and makes it incredibly difficult and expensive for an individual to challenge a massive corporation.\n\n2. The Mass Arbitration \"Kill Switch\": A System Designed to Overwhelm Justice\nOriginal Text: \"If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers... these claims will be \"Related Cases.\" ... Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time... none of the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an advanced legal maneuver to counter organized consumer action. If a large group of people (e.g., in a data breach) all try to file for arbitration at once, this clause forces them into a slow, \"batched\" process. Only 50 cases can be heard at a time. This system is designed to delay and exhaust the legal process for thousands of affected users, making it practically impossible to achieve timely justice on a large scale.\n\n3. The Liability Cap: If Microsoft's Failure Causes Catastrophic Damage, They Owe You $10\nOriginal Text: \"If you have any basis for recovering damages... you agree that your exclusive remedy is to recover, from Microsoft or any affiliates... direct damages up to an amount equal to your Services fee for the month during which the loss or breach occurred (or up to $10.00 if the Services are free). You can't recover any other damages or losses, including... lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause severely limits Microsoft's financial responsibility for any harm they cause. If a flaw in their service (like OneDrive or Outlook) causes you to lose your business data, family photos, or suffer other major damages, the absolute maximum you can recover is the fee you paid for that month, or just ten dollars if the service was free. This transfers nearly all financial risk from them to you.\n\n4. Total Warranty Disclaimer: They Legally Promise You Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS \"WITH ALL FAULTS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE.\" YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK OF USING THE SERVICES. MICROSOFT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES. ... WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT CONTENT LOSS WON'T OCCUR...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a complete disclaimer of responsibility for the quality, security, and reliability of their products. Legally, they guarantee nothing. If their services are insecure, full of errors, or if they lose all of your content, this clause states that you have accepted that entire risk, and they have no legal obligation to you.\n\n5. Your Ideas Become Theirs, for Free, Forever\nOriginal Text: \"If you give to Microsoft any idea, proposal, suggestion or feedback... (\"Feedback\"), you give to Microsoft, without charge, royalties or other obligation to you, the right to make, have made, create derivative works, use, share and commercialize your Feedback in any way and for any purpose.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause states that any idea or suggestion you send to Microsoft immediately becomes their intellectual property. They can patent it, build products from it, and profit from it, and they owe you absolutely nothing in return—no payment, no credit, no obligation.\n\n6. Consent by Reference: You Agree to a Privacy Policy You Haven't Read\nOriginal Text: \"Please read the Microsoft Privacy Statement... as it describes the types of data we collect from you... how we use your Data... by agreeing to these Terms, you consent to Microsoft's collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the Privacy Statement.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical legal maneuver. This Services Agreement doesn't detail all the ways they use your data (like for AI training or advertising). Instead, it makes you legally consent to everything written in a separate document, the Privacy Statement. Because the Privacy Statement can be updated, you are effectively pre-consenting to future data collection practices that may not even exist yet.\n\n7. The Third-Party Risk Dump: If a Connected App Harms You, It's Not Microsoft's Problem\nOriginal Text: \"You agree to assume all risk and liability arising from your use of these Third-Party Apps and Services and that Microsoft is not responsible for any issues arising out of your use of them.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Microsoft encourages an ecosystem of third-party apps and services that connect to your account (e.g., Office plugins, Xbox apps). This clause states that if one of those third-party apps steals your data, damages your computer, or causes other harm, Microsoft takes zero responsibility. You are on your own.\n\n8. The Subjective \"Code of Conduct\": A Justification to Ban Anyone for Vague Reasons\nOriginal Text: \"Don't... publicly display or use the Services to share inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence, or criminal activity).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause, while appearing reasonable, gives Microsoft sole discretion to define terms like \"inappropriate\" and \"offensive language.\" This subjectivity allows them to terminate an account or remove content based on their own internal, and often opaque, standards. A user can be in violation without understanding the specific rule they have broken.\n\n9. Account Termination at Will: Your Digital Life Can Be Deleted Without Recourse\nOriginal Text: \"Microsoft may close your account at any time and for any reason... Closing your account may result in a loss of access to the Services (and Your Content associated with those Services), software licenses, subscriptions, and Microsoft account balances associated with the account.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause explicitly states that Microsoft can delete your entire account—and everything associated with it (emails, cloud files, software licenses you paid for)—at any time, for any reason. This is the enforcement mechanism for their subjective Code of Conduct and gives them absolute power over your digital presence on their platforms.\n\n10. The \"Use It or Lose It\" Inactivity Clause: Your Data Can Be Deleted for Being Idle\nOriginal Text: \"You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active... Microsoft reserves the right to close your account if you don't sign in for a two-year period.\"\nPlain English Explanation: If you do not log in to your Microsoft account for two years, Microsoft reserves the right to permanently close it and delete everything in it. This \"use it or lose it\" policy can lead to the irreversible loss of important data, photos, or emails for users who may be elderly, ill, or simply have an account they don't use frequently.\n\n11. You Don't Own Your Software, You Rent It\nOriginal Text: \"...any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms... we grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited right to install and use the software... This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clarifies that when you use services like Microsoft 365, you are not buying a product you own. You are being granted a limited, personal, non-transferable license to use it. This license can be revoked at any time if Microsoft terminates your account, meaning you can lose access to the software you rely on.\n\n12. The Unilateral Contract Update: They Can Change the Terms, and Your Only Choice is to Quit\nOriginal Text: \"We will notify you if we change these Terms... If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Services... Otherwise, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the changed terms.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Microsoft can change this legal agreement at any time. Your only recourse if you disagree with the new terms is to stop using all their services and abandon your account. By continuing to log in, you are legally accepting the new contract, whether you have read it or not.\n\n13. Assignment of Your Contract: Microsoft Can Transfer Your Agreement to Another Company Without Your Consent\nOriginal Text: \"We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Microsoft the right to transfer its legal agreement with you to a different company (for example, if a service is sold). This can be done without notifying you. You, however, are not allowed to transfer your rights or account to anyone else.\n\nThis agreement represents a comprehensive system of legal control designed to prevent user accountability and maximize corporate protection through advanced legal engineering.\n\nTransparency Score: 16/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 13 systematic legal control mechanisms",

The agreement is particularly hostile to content creators who generate the valuable discussions that drive the platform.\n\n1. The \"We Own Everything You Post\" License: Perpetual, Irrevocable Rights to All User Content\nOriginal Text: \"By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights. You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content: When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is one of the most aggressive content licensing clauses in social media. When you post anything on Reddit—comments, posts, images, videos—you grant them permanent, irrevocable rights to use, modify, and distribute that content forever, even if you delete your account. They can sell your content to AI companies, use it in advertising, or create derivative works without ever paying you. The \"transferable and sublicensable\" language means they can sell these rights to other companies. You are essentially working for free to create Reddit's most valuable asset: user-generated content.\n\n2. Forced Arbitration: You Cannot Sue Reddit in Court\nOriginal Text: \"Any Dispute between you and Reddit will be resolved through binding individual arbitration... You and Reddit agree that any Dispute will be settled solely by binding individual arbitration and not in a class action, representative action, or other similar proceeding... THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT... YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND REDDIT MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause removes your right to sue Reddit in public court and prevents class action lawsuits. Instead, you must use private arbitration, which is expensive, secretive, and historically favors corporations. If Reddit violates your rights, steals your content, or causes you harm, you cannot join with other users in a class action lawsuit. You must fight them alone, in private, with an arbitrator that corporations typically prefer. This effectively shields Reddit from most legal accountability.\n\n3. Complete Liability Shield: Reddit is Not Responsible for Any Damages\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, WILL REDDIT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES... REDDIT'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO REDDIT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means Reddit accepts almost zero legal responsibility for any harm their platform causes you. If their platform spreads misinformation that damages your reputation, if a data breach exposes your personal information, if their algorithm promotes harassment against you, or if their negligence causes you financial loss—their maximum liability is $100 or what you paid them (often $0). This transfers all the risk of using their platform from them to you.\n\n4. Unilateral Account Termination: They Can Delete Your Account and Content Anytime\nOriginal Text: \"Reddit may terminate or suspend your Reddit account or ability to access or use the Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms... Upon termination of your account, your right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. Termination of your account does not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability you may have to Reddit or any third party.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit can delete your account, and years of posts and comments, at any time for any reason without warning. If you've built a following or used Reddit for business networking, they can destroy that with no recourse. Even after termination, you're still bound by their terms (like the content license), but they have no obligations to you. This gives them ultimate power over your digital presence on their platform.\n\n5. Unlimited Right to Change Terms: They Can Rewrite the Rules Anytime\nOriginal Text: \"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the revised Terms and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services... By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit can change these terms at any time, and your continued use means you automatically agree to whatever new terms they create. They can decide what constitutes \"material\" changes and whether to notify you. This means the agreement you thought you were signing could be completely different tomorrow, and you have no choice but to accept it or stop using the platform entirely.\n\n6. No Warranty on Service Quality: Reddit Provides No Guarantees\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT... REDDIT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit makes no promises that their service will work, be secure, or be available when you need it. If the platform goes down during important discussions, if security flaws expose your data, or if bugs cause you to lose content, they have no legal obligation to fix these problems or compensate you for any losses.\n\n7. User Content Responsibility Shift: You're Liable for Everything, They're Liable for Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"You are solely responsible for Your Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it... Reddit takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Content posted, stored, uploaded, or otherwise made available by you or any third party.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause makes you legally responsible for everything you post, but makes Reddit responsible for nothing that appears on their platform. If someone posts defamatory content about you, Reddit isn't liable. If you accidentally violate someone's copyright, you're fully liable even though Reddit profits from hosting that content. This creates a one-way liability structure where users bear all the legal risks while Reddit reaps all the benefits.\n\n8. Data Collection and Sharing: Broad Rights to Monitor and Monetize User Activity\nOriginal Text: \"We may use information about you to... provide, maintain, and improve the Services; research and develop new services; send you technical notices, security alerts, and administrative messages; communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This gives Reddit expansive rights to collect, analyze, and use your personal data for their business purposes. They can monitor your activity patterns, interests, and behaviors to build detailed profiles for advertising. While they claim to anonymize data, the combination of posting history, voting patterns, and engagement data can create highly specific user profiles that have significant commercial value.\n\nThe Reddit User Agreement represents a systematic approach to maximizing platform value while minimizing corporate responsibility, creating a fundamentally imbalanced relationship between the platform and its content-creating users.\n\nTransparency Score: 18/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 8 systematic user exploitation issues",

    "raw_content": "TikTok Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 12/100\nJustification: TikTok's Terms of Service represent one of the most aggressively user-hostile agreements in social media. The agreement combines extremely broad content licensing (including transferable rights), complete waiver of personal rights including likeness and voice, automated surveillance, parental liability transfers, shortened legal deadlines, and comprehensive corporate liability shields. Most critically, it specifically targets minors while making parents fully liable for all consequences. The score reflects systematic exploitation of both users and families, with particular concern for child safety and parental financial exposure.\n\n1. The \"God License\": Irrevocable, Permanent, and Transferable Rights to Your Content\nOriginal Text: \"...by submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, perpetual worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most important clause. It means that the moment you upload a video, you grant TikTok a permanent (\"perpetual\"), unstoppable (\"irrevocable\") right to do almost anything they want with it, for free, forever. They can modify it, create new works from it (like for ads), and even transfer or sell these rights to other companies (\"fully transferable\"). It also gives every other user and third-party companies the right to download and re-use your content, which is the basis for features like Duet and Stitch.\n\n2. Waiver of All Personal Rights: You Forfeit Control Over Your Own Image and Likeness\nOriginal Text: \"You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content... By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means TikTok can use your face, voice, and name in connection with your videos without asking your permission or paying you. Crucially, you waive your right to approve how they use your likeness in their own marketing or ads. This is an enormous concession of personal privacy and publicity rights, which is especially concerning for minors.\n\n3. Financial Responsibility is on You: The User Indemnifies TikTok for Copyright Claims\nOriginal Text: \"This means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.)...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes that if you use a popular song in your video, you are granting TikTok a free license for that music. If the record label or music publisher later sues TikTok for copyright infringement over your video, other clauses (like the Indemnity clause) could place the financial responsibility back on you, the user, for not having the proper rights.\n\n4. Automated Content Scanning: Constant Monitoring of Your Activity\nOriginal Text: \"Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause states that TikTok's software automatically scans and analyzes all content you create and interact with. This is used to personalize your feed and ads. The mention of \"emails\" is unusual and may be boilerplate language, but as written, it suggests a very broad scope of automated analysis of user data.\n\n5. Total Indemnification: If TikTok is Sued Because of You, You Pay\nOriginal Text: \"You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TikTok... from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and expenses, arising out of a breach by you or any user of your account of these Terms...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a standard but severe clause. It means that if TikTok faces a lawsuit because of something you did, posted, or uploaded, you are legally obligated to pay for their lawyers, court costs, and any financial damages. This transfers a massive amount of legal risk from the corporation to the individual user.\n\n6. The \"As Is\" Clause & Data Loss: TikTok is Not Responsible for Anything\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\"... WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR... (III) ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED BY YOU... (IV) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF... ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADVERTISING...\"\nPlain English Explanation: TikTok makes no promises that the service will be safe, secure, or reliable. They are not liable if they lose all of your data, videos, and memories. They are also not responsible if you suffer damage by relying on the accuracy of any content or advertising on the platform.\n\n7. Shortened Time to Sue: You Have Only One Year to File a Lawsuit\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE... OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action against TikTok. In many legal situations, you might have several years to file a claim (a \"statute of limitations\"). This term reduces that window to just one year, after which you permanently lose your right to sue, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n8. Parental/Guardian Liability: Adults are Fully Responsible for Minors\nOriginal Text: \"If you are under age 18, you may only use the Services with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This places the entire legal burden on the parent or guardian of a minor user. By allowing a child to use the app, the parent is legally agreeing to all of these terms on the child's behalf—including the content licenses, waivers of rights, and indemnification clauses. They are fully responsible for everything the minor does on the platform.\n\n9. Your Ideas Become Their Property, Instantly and Forever\nOriginal Text: \"You irrevocably grant us perpetual and unlimited permission to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, modify, publicly perform... and otherwise use and exploit the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause concerns any feedback, idea, or suggestion you send to TikTok. It states that the moment you send them an idea, it becomes their property to use however they want, forever, without paying you or even giving you credit. They can use your idea to create a new commercial product, patent it, and sell it, and you have no rights or claim to it whatsoever.\n\n10. The Rules Can Change at Any Time, and Your Only Choice is to Quit\nOriginal Text: \"We amend these Terms from time to time... We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes... however, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes... Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes that TikTok can change its legal agreement with you at any time. While they may try to notify you, the responsibility is on you to constantly check for updates. If they change the rules and you don't agree, your only option is to delete your account. You have no power to negotiate or reject specific changes.\n\n11. The \"Cooling Off\" Period Designed to Stop Lawsuits\nOriginal Text: \"If we have a dispute with you... the party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other... If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired... either party may file legal action against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause forces you into a mandatory \"informal dispute resolution\" process before you are allowed to sue TikTok. You must first contact them and engage in this process for up to 60 days. This acts as a procedural hurdle designed to exhaust your time and resources, making it more difficult and complicated for an average person to seek justice in a court of law.\n\n12. Your Anonymity Can Be Revoked by a Third-Party Complaint\nOriginal Text: \"We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means your perceived anonymity is conditional. If another person or company claims your video violates their copyright or privacy rights, TikTok reserves the right to give them your real-world identity. This can expose you to legal action or harassment from third parties.\n\n13. The \"We Don't Have to Police the Platform\" Shield\nOriginal Text: \"You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you and other users on the Services (including User Content).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a crucial liability shield for TikTok. It states they have no legal duty to check content before it is posted to ensure it is safe or legal. They reserve the right to take things down later, but they are not responsible for failing to catch harmful, dangerous, or illegal content before it is seen by users, including children. This puts the burden of safety on users to report content after the fact.\n\n14. The \"California Eraser\" Clause (With Hurdles)\nOriginal Text: \"Users of the Services who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request and obtain removal of User Content they posted... All requests must be labeled 'California Removal Request' on the email subject line... We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, and we may not be able to respond if you do not provide adequate information.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This section addresses a California law that gives minors the right to have their own posts removed. While TikTok provides a path to do this, they include specific procedural requirements. If a teenager (or their parent) fails to label the email correctly or provide \"adequate information,\" TikTok states they are not responsible and may not be able to respond, potentially nullifying this legal protection on a technicality.\n\nThe combination of these clauses creates an environment of near-total corporate control and near-zero corporate liability, with particular exploitation of minors and families.\n\nTransparency Score: 12/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 14 systematic exploitation issues with special concern for minors",

By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means TikTok can use your face, voice, and name in connection with your videos without asking your permission or paying you.

This is an enormous concession of personal privacy and publicity rights, which is especially concerning for minors.\n\n3. Financial Responsibility is on You: The User Indemnifies TikTok for Copyright Claims\nOriginal Text: \"This means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.)...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes that if you use a popular song in your video, you are granting TikTok a free license for that music.

It means that if TikTok faces a lawsuit because of something you did, posted, or uploaded, you are legally obligated to pay for their lawyers, court costs, and any financial damages.

(III) ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED BY YOU... (IV) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF... ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADVERTISING...\"\nPlain English Explanation: TikTok makes no promises that the service will be safe, secure, or reliable. They are not liable if they lose all of your data, videos, and memories. They are also not responsible if you suffer damage by relying on the accuracy of any content or advertising on the platform.\n\n7. Shortened Time to Sue: You Have Only One Year to File a Lawsuit\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE... OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action against TikTok. In many legal situations, you might have several years to file a claim (a \"statute of limitations\"). This term reduces that window to just one year, after which you permanently lose your right to sue, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n8. Parental/Guardian Liability: Adults are Fully Responsible for Minors\nOriginal Text: \"If you are under age 18, you may only use the Services with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This places the entire legal burden on the parent or guardian of a minor user. By allowing a child to use the app, the parent is legally agreeing to all of these terms on the child's behalf—including the content licenses, waivers of rights, and indemnification clauses. They are fully responsible for everything the minor does on the platform.\n\n9. Your Ideas Become Their Property, Instantly and Forever\nOriginal Text: \"You irrevocably grant us perpetual and unlimited permission to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, modify, publicly perform... and otherwise use and exploit the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause concerns any feedback, idea, or suggestion you send to TikTok. It states that the moment you send them an idea, it becomes their property to use however they want, forever, without paying you or even giving you credit. They can use your idea to create a new commercial product, patent it, and sell it, and you have no rights or claim to it whatsoever.\n\n10. The Rules Can Change at Any Time, and Your Only Choice is to Quit\nOriginal Text: \"We amend these Terms from time to time... We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes... however, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes... Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes that TikTok can change its legal agreement with you at any time. While they may try to notify you, the responsibility is on you to constantly check for updates. If they change the rules and you don't agree, your only option is to delete your account. You have no power to negotiate or reject specific changes.\n\n11. The \"Cooling Off\" Period Designed to Stop Lawsuits\nOriginal Text: \"If we have a dispute with you... the party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other... If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired... either party may file legal action against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause forces you into a mandatory \"informal dispute resolution\" process before you are allowed to sue TikTok. You must first contact them and engage in this process for up to 60 days. This acts as a procedural hurdle designed to exhaust your time and resources, making it more difficult and complicated for an average person to seek justice in a court of law.\n\n12. Your Anonymity Can Be Revoked by a Third-Party Complaint\nOriginal Text: \"We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means your perceived anonymity is conditional. If another person or company claims your video violates their copyright or privacy rights, TikTok reserves the right to give them your real-world identity. This can expose you to legal action or harassment from third parties.\n\n13. The \"We Don't Have to Police the Platform\" Shield\nOriginal Text: \"You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you and other users on the Services (including User Content).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a crucial liability shield for TikTok. It states they have no legal duty to check content before it is posted to ensure it is safe or legal. They reserve the right to take things down later, but they are not responsible for failing to catch harmful, dangerous, or illegal content before it is seen by users, including children. This puts the burden of safety on users to report content after the fact.\n\n14. The \"California Eraser\" Clause (With Hurdles)\nOriginal Text: \"Users of the Services who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request and obtain removal of User Content they posted... All requests must be labeled 'California Removal Request' on the email subject line... We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, and we may not be able to respond if you do not provide adequate information.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This section addresses a California law that gives minors the right to have their own posts removed. While TikTok provides a path to do this, they include specific procedural requirements. If a teenager (or their parent) fails to label the email correctly or provide \"adequate information,\" TikTok states they are not responsible and may not be able to respond, potentially nullifying this legal protection on a technicality.\n\nThe combination of these clauses creates an environment of near-total corporate control and near-zero corporate liability, with particular exploitation of minors and families.\n\nTransparency Score: 12/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 14 systematic exploitation issues with special concern for minors",

    "raw_content": "Bank of America Online Banking Service Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 8/100\nJustification: Bank of America's Online Banking Service Agreement represents the most systemically dangerous financial services agreement analyzed. It combines complete abandonment of fraud protection (Zelle® scam liability), automated surveillance and recording systems, mandatory data sharing with third parties, artificial liability caps ($100 maximum regardless of bank errors), and discretionary overdraft fee generation. Most critically, it weaponizes digital banking tools against customers while providing maximum legal protection for the bank. The score reflects systematic financial exploitation with particular concern for vulnerable customers who rely on digital banking.\n\n1. The Zelle® \"Trust\" Trap: Bank Abandons All Liability for Scams\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICE IS INTENDED TO SEND MONEY TO FRIENDS, FAMILY AND OTHERS YOU TRUST. YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICE TO SEND MONEY TO RECIPIENTS WITH WHOM YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR OR YOU DO NOT TRUST. NEITHER WE NOR ZELLE® OFFER PURCHASE PROTECTION FOR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE (FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU DO NOT RECEIVE THE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT YOU PAID FOR, OR THE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT YOU RECEIVED ARE DAMAGED OR ARE OTHERWISE NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical warning. Unlike credit card transactions, Zelle® payments are like handing someone cash. If you are tricked into sending money to a scammer, the bank considers it an \"authorized\" payment. They state explicitly that they offer zero purchase protection, and you are solely responsible for the loss. The bank will not help you recover your money.\n\n2. The Security Black Hole: Your Responsibility if Your Password is Used\nOriginal Text: \"If you permit another person to use your User ID and password... you are responsible for all transactions that person performs (even if he or she exceeds your authorization), until you notify us that the person is no longer authorized... Bank of America will have no liability to you for any unauthorized payment or transfer made using your password that occurs before you have notified us... and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause places the entire burden of password security on you. If you give someone access for one specific reason (e.g., to pay a single bill) and they proceed to drain your account, the bank holds you responsible for all of it until you successfully report the issue. The vague \"reasonable opportunity to act\" gives the bank significant leeway to deny liability.\n\n3. The Liability Cap: If the Bank Causes Catastrophic Loss, They Owe You Almost Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"IN THOSE STATES WHERE THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES MAY NOT APPLY, ANY LIABILITY OF US OR OUR VENDORS... SHALL, IN NO EVENT, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the bank's ultimate liability shield. It states that even in cases where they are found legally liable for damages (for example, resulting from a major security failure on their end), the absolute maximum they will pay you is $100. This clause attempts to protect the bank from any meaningful financial accountability for its errors.\n\n4. The Dispute Clock: Your Rights Evaporate in 60 Days\nOriginal Text: \"We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we have sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared... If you do not, you may not get back any of the money you lost from any unauthorized transaction that occurs after the close of the 60-day period...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes your window to report an error or unauthorized transaction. If you don't meticulously review your statements and report an issue within 60 days of the statement date, you can permanently lose your right to get your money back. This puts a strict and often difficult-to-meet deadline on customers to protect their own funds.\n\n5. \"Erica\" the AI Assistant: A Surveillance and Liability Device\nOriginal Text: \"Once you initiate an interaction with Erica, we will record and transcribe these interactions... Erica may capture, record, and transcribe other voices in addition to yours... We will treat all voice interactions and transactions as though you authorized them... even if another voice or person initiated or completed them. Bank of America uses a third-party service provider to provide voice responses, which keeps a record of your conversations...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This reveals that the \"Erica\" assistant is a constant recording device. It records and transcribes everything it hears—including background conversations and other people's voices—and shares these recordings with an unnamed third-party company. Critically, the bank states it will treat any voice command it hears as an authorized transaction from you, creating a massive security and privacy risk.\n\n6. Automatic Enrollment in Data Sharing Programs\nOriginal Text: \"By enrolling in online and mobile banking, you will be automatically enrolled in the Bank's merchant rewards program, BankAmeriDeals, whereby the Bank will share anonymized transaction information with vendors... By using the Services, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device... to Bank of America or its service provider... to prevent fraud.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause states that you are automatically opted-in to programs that share your financial data. Your spending history (\"anonymized transaction information\") is shared with third-party vendors for advertising purposes. Furthermore, you give permission for your cell phone company to share your account and device information with the bank, eroding the privacy of two separate services simultaneously.\n\n7. The \"As Is\" Service: The Bank Guarantees Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"NEITHER WE NOR OUR VENDORS... WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE... THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a comprehensive disclaimer of quality and security. The bank provides the online and mobile banking services with no legal guarantee that they will work correctly, be available when you need them, or be secure from errors and attacks. You, the customer, assume all the risk of using their digital services.\n\n8. The Unilateral Contract: They Can Change the Rules at Any Time, and the Burden is on You to Notice\nOriginal Text: \"We may add, delete or change the terms of this Agreement at any time. We will inform you of changes when legally required and will try to inform you of the nature of any material changes even when not legally required to do so... You agree that by continuing to use the Services after the date that changes are posted to our website, such changes will be effective for transactions made after that date, whether or not you access the website or otherwise receive actual notice of the changes.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause states that the bank can change this legal contract whenever they want. The responsibility is on you to constantly check their website for updates. Your continued use of the online service is legally considered your acceptance of the new terms, even if you have not actually read or received notice of the changes.\n\n9. The \"Commercially Reasonable\" Security Shield: Following Their Rules Matters More Than Your Actual Security\nOriginal Text: \"By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that this Agreement sets forth security procedures for electronic banking transactions that are commercially reasonable. You agree to be bound by instructions, whether authorized or unauthorized, which we implement in compliance with these procedures...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a powerful legal shield for the bank. It says that as long as they follow their own internal security procedures, you are legally bound by any transaction that occurs—even if it was unauthorized. This shifts the legal argument from \"Did the customer actually approve this?\" to \"Did the bank follow its own checklist?\"\n\n10. The Discretionary Overdraft: They Can Choose to Cause an Overdraft and Charge You Fees\nOriginal Text: \"If an account does not have sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect not to initiate one or more of the transfers. If we do elect to initiate the transfer... it may cause an overdraft in your account in which case you shall be fully responsible for the overdraft and any Overdraft Item Fees...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives the bank a choice when you have a bill payment scheduled but not enough money. They can either decline the payment (which may cause you to incur a late fee from the payee) or they can approve the payment, intentionally causing an overdraft for which they will charge you a fee. The decision is entirely theirs, and either outcome can be financially negative for you.\n\n11. The Currency Exchange Markup: They Explicitly State Their Rate Will Be Worse for You\nOriginal Text: \"If we assign an exchange rate to your foreign exchange transaction, that exchange rate will be determined by us in our sole discretion... The exchange rate you are offered may be different from, and likely inferior to, the rate paid by us to acquire the underlying currency. We provide all-in pricing for exchange rates. The price provided may include profit, fees, costs, charges or other markups...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a direct admission that the bank builds a profit margin into the currency exchange rates it offers you. They state that the rate you get is determined in their \"sole discretion\" and will be \"likely inferior\" to the actual market rate they get. This markup is a hidden cost of the service.\n\n12. Termination Without Obligation: They Can Cut Off Your Access and Aren't Required to Tell You First\nOriginal Text: \"We may terminate your participation in any or all of your Services for any reason, including inactivity, at any time. We will try to notify you in advance, but we are not obliged to do so.\"\nPlain English Explanation: The bank reserves the right to terminate your access to your online banking tools whenever they want, for any reason. While they say they will \"try\" to give you notice, they explicitly state they have no legal obligation to warn you before they do it.\n\n13. Joint Account Liability: Any One Owner Can Act for All Owners\nOriginal Text: \"When your Service is linked to one or more joint accounts, we may act on the verbal, written or electronic instructions of any authorized signer.\"\nPlain English Explanation: For joint accounts, this means the bank can treat an instruction from one owner as an instruction from all owners. This can have significant consequences, as one person could make a major transaction or change account settings without the direct, immediate consent of the other account holders.\n\nThis agreement systematically protects the institution while exposing customers to maximum financial risk and surveillance, representing the worst practices in financial services.\n\nTransparency Score: 8/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 13 systematic financial exploitation issues",

    "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/terms",
    "raw_content": "Anthropic (Claude) Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 65/100\nJustification: Anthropic's Terms of Service represents a significant departure from industry norms with genuinely user-friendly data ownership and training opt-out provisions. However, it still employs standard corporate liability shields, indemnification clauses, and unilateral service control. The score reflects a more respectful approach to user rights while maintaining necessary legal protections. This is a modern, thoughtful contract that balances user interests with corporate protection, though it still contains significant risk-transfer mechanisms.\n\n1. The Ownership Reversal: You Own Your Inputs and Outputs\nOriginal Text: \"As between you and Anthropic, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain any right, title, and interest that you have in the Inputs you submit. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all of our right, title, and interest—if any—in Outputs.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most significant and user-friendly clause in the entire document, and a radical departure from other platforms. Anthropic states that you own what you put in, and, critically, they give you ownership of the content Claude generates for you. Unlike platforms that grant themselves a sweeping license to use your content, Anthropic explicitly transfers ownership of the output to you.\n\n2. The Training Opt-Out: You Have Control Over Your Data's Use for AI Training\nOriginal Text: \"We may use Materials to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to develop other products and services, including training our models, unless you opt out of training through your account settings. Even if you opt out, we will use Materials for model training when: ... (2) your Materials are flagged for safety review...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is another major pro-user feature. Anthropic gives you the ability to opt-out of having your conversations used to train their future AI models. This is a level of control not offered by many other services. However, it's crucial to note the exception: if your conversation is flagged for a safety violation, they will still use that specific conversation for training purposes to improve their safety systems.\n\n3. The \"Business Domain\" Trap: Your Work Email Means Your Boss Can See Everything\nOriginal Text: \"If you use an email address owned by your employer or another organization, your Account may be linked to the organization's Anthropic enterprise account, and the organization's administrator may be able to monitor and control the Account, including having access to Materials...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical warning for anyone using the service with a work or school email. It means your employer's IT administrator could gain full access to your account and all of your conversations with Claude. You should never use a work-provided email for personal or sensitive queries on the platform.\n\n4. The Liability Cap: The Standard $100 Limit on Accountability\nOriginal Text: \"...THE ANTHROPIC PARTIES' TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU... WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE SIX MONTHS PRECEDING... AND $100.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Despite its user-friendly data policies, Anthropic uses the same aggressive liability cap as other major tech companies. This means if their failure (like a data breach or system error) causes you massive financial or personal damage, the absolute maximum they will be liable for is $100 or the fees you paid in the last six months.\n\n5. The Honest Warning and Liability Shield: AI is Unreliable\nOriginal Text: \"Artificial intelligence and large language models are frontier technologies that are still improving... When you use our Services, you acknowledge and agree: ... Outputs may not be accurate, reliable, or complete... You must evaluate Outputs for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including by using human review...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause is both an honest disclaimer and a powerful legal shield. Anthropic is direct that Claude can be wrong and produce inaccurate information. By using the service, you agree that the responsibility is entirely on you to fact-check and verify everything it produces. You cannot hold Anthropic liable for damages caused by acting on false or flawed information generated by the AI.\n\n6. The Standard Indemnification: You Pay Their Legal Bills\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE ANTHROPIC PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS), AND OTHER LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO... YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR ALLEGED USE OF THE SERVICES...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the same risk-transfer clause seen everywhere. If Anthropic is sued because of how you used their service or the content you created with it, you are legally responsible for paying all of their legal fees and any resulting damages.\n\n7. No Forced Arbitration, But... You Still Have to Sue in California\nOriginal Text: \"...any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and Anthropic submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is significantly better than Microsoft's mandatory arbitration clause, as it preserves your right to a day in court. However, it still creates a major hurdle. It forces you to file any lawsuit in San Francisco, which is prohibitively expensive and impractical for the vast majority of users, effectively discouraging most legal action.\n\n8. The Unilateral Contract Update: The Rules Can Change, and Your Only Vote is to Leave\nOriginal Text: \"If you continue to access the Services after we post the updated Terms on Anthropic's website or otherwise give you notice of Terms changes, then you agree to the updated Terms. If you do not accept the updated Terms, you must stop using our Services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a standard but critical clause. It states that Anthropic can change its legal agreement with you at any time. Your only choice is to accept the new rules by continuing to use the service, or reject them by deleting your account. This makes the contract a living document that you are perpetually agreeing to, whether you've read the updates or not.\n\n9. Termination Without Notice & The Inactivity Clock: Your Access is Conditional\nOriginal Text: \"We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services... at any time without notice to you if we believe that you have breached these Terms... We may also terminate your Account if you have been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid Account.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Anthropic two powerful rights. First, they can cut off your access instantly and without warning if they decide you have violated their rules. Second, they can permanently delete your account and all associated data if you haven't used it for a year (for free accounts), effectively a \"use it or lose it\" policy for your data.\n\n10. No Absolute Privacy from Law Enforcement: Your Data Can Be Reported\nOriginal Text: \"We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to report information from or about you, including but not limited to Inputs, Outputs, or Actions to law enforcement.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause makes it clear that your interactions with Claude are not completely private. Anthropic explicitly reserves the right to proactively turn over your data—including your prompts and Claude's responses—to law enforcement agencies if they choose to.\n\n11. The Service Can Vanish at Any Time: No Guarantee of Availability\nOriginal Text: \"Unless we specifically agree otherwise in a separate agreement with you, we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means that Anthropic does not guarantee that Claude.ai or any of its features will exist tomorrow. They can change, suspend, or completely shut down the service whenever they want. While they say they will \"strive\" to give notice, they are not legally obligated to, especially in what they deem \"urgent situations.\"\n\n12. Developer's Risk: If You Build on Claude, Your Product is Their Shield\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE ANTHROPIC PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES... ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO... Any products or services that you develop, offer, or otherwise make available using or otherwise in connection with the Services...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a crucial clause for anyone building an application or business that uses Claude. It means that if you create a product powered by Claude and someone sues Anthropic because of something your product did, you are legally required to pay for all of Anthropic's legal defense costs and any damages. This transfers the entire legal risk of innovation from their platform to you, the developer.\n\nWhile Anthropic's ToS contains genuinely user-friendly innovations in data ownership and training control, it still employs standard corporate legal protections that transfer significant risk to users and developers.\n\nTransparency Score: 65/100 - Medium Risk Level\nRed Flags: 8 standard corporate protection mechanisms with significant user-friendly exceptions",
    "cleaned_content": "Anthropic (Claude) Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 65/100\nJustification: Anthropic's Terms of Service represents a significant departure from industry norms with genuinely user-friendly data ownership and training opt-out provisions. However, it still employs standard corporate liability shields, indemnification clauses, and unilateral service control. The score reflects a more respectful approach to user rights while maintaining necessary legal protections. This is a modern, thoughtful contract that balances user interests with corporate protection, though it still contains significant risk-transfer mechanisms.\n\n1. The Ownership Reversal: You Own Your Inputs and Outputs\nOriginal Text: \"As between you and Anthropic, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain any right, title, and interest that you have in the Inputs you submit. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all of our right, title, and interest—if any—in Outputs.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most significant and user-friendly clause in the entire document, and a radical departure from other platforms. Anthropic states that you own what you put in, and, critically, they give you ownership of the content Claude generates for you. Unlike platforms that grant themselves a sweeping license to use your content, Anthropic explicitly transfers ownership of the output to you.\n\n2. The Training Opt-Out: You Have Control Over Your Data's Use for AI Training\nOriginal Text: \"We may use Materials to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to develop other products and services, including training our models, unless you opt out of training through your account settings. Even if you opt out, we will use Materials for model training when: ... (2) your Materials are flagged for safety review...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is another major pro-user feature. Anthropic gives you the ability to opt-out of having your conversations used to train their future AI models. This is a level of control not offered by many other services. However, it's crucial to note the exception: if your conversation is flagged for a safety violation, they will still use that specific conversation for training purposes to improve their safety systems.\n\n3. The \"Business Domain\" Trap: Your Work Email Means Your Boss Can See Everything\nOriginal Text: \"If you use an email address owned by your employer or another organization, your Account may be linked to the organization's Anthropic enterprise account, and the organization's administrator may be able to monitor and control the Account, including having access to Materials...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical warning for anyone using the service with a work or school email. It means your employer's IT administrator could gain full access to your account and all of your conversations with Claude. You should never use a work-provided email for personal or sensitive queries on the platform.\n\n4. The Liability Cap: The Standard $100 Limit on Accountability\nOriginal Text: \"...THE ANTHROPIC PARTIES' TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU... WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE SIX MONTHS PRECEDING... AND $100.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Despite its user-friendly data policies, Anthropic uses the same aggressive liability cap as other major tech companies. This means if their failure (like a data breach or system error) causes you massive financial or personal damage, the absolute maximum they will be liable for is $100 or the fees you paid in the last six months.\n\n5. The Honest Warning and Liability Shield: AI is Unreliable\nOriginal Text: \"Artificial intelligence and large language models are frontier technologies that are still improving... When you use our Services, you acknowledge and agree: ... Outputs may not be accurate, reliable, or complete... You must evaluate Outputs for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including by using human review...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause is both an honest disclaimer and a powerful legal shield.

    "raw_content": "Otter.ai Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 22/100\nJustification: Otter.ai's Terms of Service are particularly concerning because they govern a service that records and processes private conversations, yet they employ aggressive legal protections that maximize corporate benefit while minimizing user rights. The agreement combines forced arbitration, mandatory AI training on conversation data, business email surveillance, and complete transcription accuracy disclaimers. The score reflects the heightened risk when sensitive conversation data is subject to standard tech industry exploitation practices without meaningful user protections.\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet: You Forfeit Your Right to Sue\nOriginal Text: \"...you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND OTTER.AI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a complete waiver of your fundamental legal rights. You cannot sue Otter.ai in a real court before a judge or jury. You are also forbidden from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. You are forced into a private, individual arbitration process, which heavily favors the corporation.\n\n2. The Mandatory AI Training Clause: Your Conversations Improve Their Product, Whether You Like It or Not\nOriginal Text: \"You acknowledge and agree that Otter.ai may collect, create, process, transmit, store, use, and disclose aggregated and/or deidentified data derived from Data or use of the Services (\"Aggregated Data\") for its business purposes, including for machine learning and training, industry analysis, benchmarking, and analytics.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Otter.ai the right to use data derived from your recorded conversations to train its machine learning models. While they state the data is \"aggregated and/or deidentified,\" this is a mandatory opt-in. Unlike some competitors, they do not offer a clear way for individual users to opt-out of having their data used for these training purposes.\n\n3. The Liability Cap: If They Fail, You Get $100\nOriginal Text: \"...THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE OTTER.AI ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO OTTER.AI FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR... OR (B) $100.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the standard but predatory liability cap. If a failure by Otter.ai—such as a catastrophic data breach of your most confidential conversations—causes you immense damage, the absolute maximum financial responsibility they accept is $100 or the fees you paid in the previous year.\n\n4. The Accuracy Disclaimer: They Legally Guarantee Nothing About Their Core Product\nOriginal Text: \"OTTER.AI MAKES NO WARRANTY ABOUT THE COMPLETENESS OR ACCURACY OF THE TRANSCRIPTION... YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON AI OUTPUTS WITHOUT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMING THEIR ACCURACY.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical disclaimer for a transcription service. Legally, Otter.ai makes zero promises that the transcriptions will be accurate. The entire responsibility for verifying the accuracy of the notes falls on you. You cannot hold them liable for damages caused by an inaccurate transcription.\n\n5. The \"Your Ideas Are Ours\" Clause\nOriginal Text: \"If you choose to provide... (\"Feedback\"), then you hereby grant Otter.ai an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Any idea or suggestion you provide to Otter.ai immediately becomes their property to use and profit from, forever, without any payment or credit to you.\n\n6. The Business Email Trap: Your Work Email is Not Private\nOriginal Text: \"If the domain of the email address associated with your account is owned by an Organization... you acknowledge and agree that we may identify your account to the Organization, migrate your account to the Organization's account, and/or restrict or terminate access to your account.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a severe warning. If you sign up for a personal Otter account using your work email address, Otter can report your account's existence to your employer and even forcibly merge it into your employer's corporate account, giving them potential access to your private recordings.\n\n7. The Service Termination Clause: Your Conversations Can Disappear\nOriginal Text: \"Otter.ai may immediately terminate or suspend your access to the Service... at any time for any reason or no reason... Upon termination, your right to access and use the Service will cease immediately, and we may, without liability to you, delete your account and all related information and files.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Otter.ai can delete your account and all of your recorded conversations at any time, for any reason or no reason at all. They explicitly state they have no liability to you for this deletion, meaning you could lose months or years of important meeting recordings permanently.\n\n8. The Data Retention Ambiguity: No Clear Promise About When Your Data Gets Deleted\nOriginal Text: \"We may retain some or all of your Data for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. We may also retain and use your Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Otter.ai broad discretion to keep your conversation data indefinitely for vague \"commercially reasonable\" purposes. There's no clear timeline for when your recordings and transcriptions will be permanently deleted from their systems.\n\n9. The Third-Party Integration Risk Transfer\nOriginal Text: \"When you connect our Service to third-party platforms or services... any data shared with or accessed through those platforms is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms. Otter.ai is not responsible for how third parties handle your data.\"\nPlain English Explanation: If you connect Otter.ai to other services (like Zoom, Slack, or Google Calendar), Otter.ai transfers all responsibility for data protection to those third parties. If one of those integrations leads to a data breach or misuse of your recordings, Otter.ai claims no liability.\n\nThis agreement applies standard tech industry exploitation practices to one of the most sensitive data types—private conversation recordings—creating heightened privacy and security risks.\n\nTransparency Score: 22/100 - High Risk Level\nRed Flags: 9 conversation privacy and corporate control issues",

    "raw_content": "Fathom Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 35/100\nJustification: Fathom's Terms of Service demonstrate a mixed approach with some genuine user-friendly improvements over competitors (AI training opt-out, two-sided indemnification for paid users) while maintaining standard corporate legal protections. The agreement shows that better policies are possible in the conversation recording space, though it still employs forced arbitration, aggressive intellectual property clauses, and liability caps. The score reflects meaningful improvements in specific areas while preserving industry-standard risk transfer mechanisms.\n\n1. The Same Forced Arbitration Gauntlet\nOriginal Text: \"...you agree that disputes between us will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND FATHOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Just like Otter.ai, Fathom forces you to give up your right to sue them in court or participate in a class-action lawsuit. Your only recourse is individual, binding arbitration, which limits your power as a consumer.\n\n2. A Better AI Training Policy (With an Opt-Out)\nOriginal Text: \"We may use and create de-identified data generated from your User Content to train, customize or improve our in-house artificial intelligence models in order to improve our Service. You can opt out of the use of your de-identified data in this manner within your Fathom account settings.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a significant and positive difference from Otter.ai. While Fathom also uses your data to train their AI, they provide you with a clear method to opt-out of this practice in your account settings. This gives you meaningful control over how your conversational data is used.\n\n3. The Two-Sided Indemnity (But Only If You Pay)\nOriginal Text: \"We will indemnify and hold you harmless from any costs, damages, expenses, and liability caused by any third-party claim (\"Claim\") alleging that your use of the Service infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, or trademark... For the avoidance of doubt, Fathom's indemnity obligations of this Section do not apply to the free edition of our Service.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is rare and important. While you are required to pay Fathom's legal bills if you cause them to be sued (standard indemnification), they offer to do the same for you if their service infringes on a copyright or patent. This is a valuable protection for businesses. However, they explicitly state this protection does not apply to users of the free version.\n\n4. The Aggressive \"Your Ideas Are Ours\" Clause\nOriginal Text: \"You acknowledge and agree that Fathom shall own all right, title and interest in the Feedback and is the sole exclusive owner of Feedback and you assign all rights, title and interest you have in such Feedback to Fathom together with all intellectual property rights therein.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is even more aggressive than Otter's clause. You are not just granting them a license to use your ideas; you are legally assigning full ownership of your ideas to Fathom. The moment you suggest an improvement, it is no longer yours in any capacity.\n\n5. Team Account Data Belongs to the Company, Not You\nOriginal Text: \"If you sign up for our Service as an Authorized User as part of your company's business Team Account, the User Content in that Team Account belongs to your company.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical warning for employees. Any meeting you record using your company's Fathom account does not belong to you. The recordings and all associated data are the legal property of your employer, who can access, review, or delete it at will.\n\n6. The Standard $100 Liability Cap\nOriginal Text: \"...THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE FATHOM ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) US$100 AND (II) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU OR PAYABLE BY YOU... DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Like the others, Fathom limits their total financial responsibility for any harm they cause you to a maximum of $100 or your last 12 months of fees. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for their potential failures.\n\n7. Service Termination and Data Deletion\nOriginal Text: \"Fathom may terminate your access to all or any part of our Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice... Upon termination of your Account, your right to access and use the Service will terminate immediately. You acknowledge and agree that Fathom may immediately deactivate or delete your Account and all related information...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Fathom can delete your account and all your conversation recordings at any time, for any reason or no reason. They have no obligation to preserve your data after termination, meaning important meeting recordings could be permanently lost if they decide to close your account.\n\n8. The Data Retention Ambiguity\nOriginal Text: \"We may retain some or all of your User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, fraud prevention, analytics, or audit purposes. We may also retain and use your User Content as necessary to comply with our legal obligations...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Like Otter.ai, Fathom gives itself broad discretion to keep your conversation data for undefined \"commercially reasonable\" periods. There's no clear commitment about when your recordings will be permanently deleted from their systems.\n\n9. Third-Party Service Integration Risks\nOriginal Text: \"Your use of any third-party service to access our Service is solely between you and the applicable third-party service provider... We disclaim all liability with respect to these third-party services...\"\nPlain English Explanation: If you connect Fathom to other services (like Zoom, Slack, or calendar apps), Fathom disclaims all responsibility for how those integrations handle your data. If a connected service causes a data breach or misuses your recordings, Fathom accepts no liability.\n\nWhile Fathom shows some improvements over industry norms with AI training opt-out and two-sided indemnification for paid users, it still employs standard corporate risk-transfer mechanisms that limit user rights and protections.\n\nTransparency Score: 35/100 - High Risk Level\nRed Flags: 7 corporate control mechanisms with some user-friendly improvements",
    "cleaned_content": "Fathom Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 35/100\nJustification: Fathom's Terms of Service demonstrate a mixed approach with some genuine user-friendly improvements over competitors (AI training opt-out, two-sided indemnification for paid users) while maintaining standard corporate legal protections. The agreement shows that better policies are possible in the conversation recording space, though it still employs forced arbitration, aggressive intellectual property clauses, and liability caps. The score reflects meaningful improvements in specific areas while preserving industry-standard risk transfer mechanisms.\n\n1. The Same Forced Arbitration Gauntlet\nOriginal Text: \"...you agree that disputes between us will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND FATHOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Just like Otter.ai, Fathom forces you to give up your right to sue them in court or participate in a class-action lawsuit. Your only recourse is individual, binding arbitration, which limits your power as a consumer.\n\n2. A Better AI Training Policy (With an Opt-Out)\nOriginal Text: \"We may use and create de-identified data generated from your User Content to train, customize or improve our in-house artificial intelligence models in order to improve our Service. You can opt out of the use of your de-identified data in this manner within your Fathom account settings.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a significant and positive difference from Otter.ai. While Fathom also uses your data to train their AI, they provide you with a clear method to opt-out of this practice in your account settings. This gives you meaningful control over how your conversational data is used.\n\n3. The Two-Sided Indemnity (But Only If You Pay)\nOriginal Text: \"We will indemnify and hold you harmless from any costs, damages, expenses, and liability caused by any third-party claim (\"Claim\") alleging that your use of the Service infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, or trademark... For the avoidance of doubt, Fathom's indemnity obligations of this Section do not apply to the free edition of our Service.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is rare and important. While you are required to pay Fathom's legal bills if you cause them to be sued (standard indemnification), they offer to do the same for you if their service infringes on a copyright or patent. This is a valuable protection for businesses. However, they explicitly state this protection does not apply to users of the free version.\n\n4. The Aggressive \"Your Ideas Are Ours\" Clause\nOriginal Text: \"You acknowledge and agree that Fathom shall own all right, title and interest in the Feedback and is the sole exclusive owner of Feedback and you assign all rights, title and interest you have in such Feedback to Fathom together with all intellectual property rights therein.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is even more aggressive than Otter's clause. You are not just granting them a license to use your ideas; you are legally assigning full ownership of your ideas to Fathom. The moment you suggest an improvement, it is no longer yours in any capacity.\n\n5. Team Account Data Belongs to the Company, Not You\nOriginal Text: \"If you sign up for our Service as an Authorized User as part of your company's business Team Account, the User Content in that Team Account belongs to your company.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical warning for employees. Any meeting you record using your company's Fathom account does not belong to you. The recordings and all associated data are the legal property of your employer, who can access, review, or delete it at will.\n\n6. The Standard $100 Liability Cap\nOriginal Text: \"...THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE FATHOM ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS... IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) US$100 AND (II) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU OR PAYABLE BY YOU... DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Like the others, Fathom limits their total financial responsibility for any harm they cause you to a maximum of $100 or your last 12 months of fees. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for their potential failures.\n\n7. Service Termination and Data Deletion\nOriginal Text: \"Fathom may terminate your access to all or any part of our Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice...

The agreement systematically strips users of legal recourse while maximizing corporate control over public discourse. The score reflects the platform's transformation into a data extraction and AI training operation that weaponizes user content while providing minimal user protections or accountability.\n\n1. The AI Training Clause: Your Content is Explicitly AI Fuel\nOriginal Text: \"You agree that this license includes the right for us to... provide, promote, and improve the Services, including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a direct and explicit statement that everything you post on X—your thoughts, opinions, photos, and videos—can and will be used to train their AI models. By using the service, you are providing the free raw material for the development of their future AI products.\n\n2. The \"Everything\" License: A Sweeping, Perpetual Right to Your Content\nOriginal Text: \"By submitting, posting or displaying Content... you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, upload, download, and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or later developed, for any purpose.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the standard, maximalist content license. It means you give X permanent, free rein to do almost anything they want with what you post. They can modify it, sell the rights to it to other companies (\"sublicense\"), and use it in any way they see fit to run and promote their service, without ever paying you.\n\n3. The Liquidated Damages Clause: A Financial Penalty for Scraping\nOriginal Text: \"...if you violate the Terms... by requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts... in any 24-hour period - $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts. You agree that these amounts are (i) a reasonable estimate of our damages; (ii) not a penalty...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a highly unusual and aggressive clause. It pre-sets a massive financial penalty for users or automated systems that access too much data (\"scraping\"). It is designed to be a powerful deterrent against researchers, archivists, or competitors trying to analyze the platform's public data on a large scale.\n\n4. The Standard $100 Liability Cap\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE X ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\"\nPlain English Explanation: If X's failure causes you catastrophic harm (e.g., a massive data breach, loss of your business's account), the absolute maximum financial responsibility they accept is $100 or the fees you paid them in the last six months.\n\n5. The Shortened Time to Sue: One Year or Your Rights Are Gone\nOriginal Text: \"You and X agree that you must initiate any proceeding or action within one (1) year of the date of the occurrence of the event... Otherwise... you forever waive the right to pursue any claim...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action. You are forced to file any lawsuit within one year of the incident, or your right to do so is permanently lost.\n\n6. The Home Court Advantage: You Must Sue in Texas\nOriginal Text: \"All disputes related to these Terms or the Services... will be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This forces any user with a legal dispute to file their lawsuit in Texas, regardless of where they live.

    "raw_content": "Telegram Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 45/100\nJustification: Telegram's Terms of Service employ a unique and concerning strategy of strategic omission rather than explicit exploitation. Unlike other platforms that aggressively claim user rights, Telegram creates dangerous legal ambiguity by omitting critical clauses entirely. The document lacks fundamental protections like content licensing definitions, liability caps, and dispute resolution mechanisms. This absence is not accidental—it creates maximum operational flexibility for Telegram while leaving users in legal limbo with no contractual protections. The score reflects that while less overtly hostile than other platforms, the legal uncertainty may be equally harmful.\n\n1. The Void: The Missing Content License Clause\nObservation: The document contains no clause defining what license you grant Telegram to your content. This is the single most important and glaring omission. Every other major service (Meta, Google, X, TikTok, etc.) has a detailed clause explaining that you grant them a broad, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your content.\nPlain English Explanation: Because they do not define the license, the legal status of your content (messages, photos, videos) on their platform is dangerously unclear. While they state they offer \"unlimited cloud storage,\" they do not legally specify what rights they have to access, scan, or use that stored content. This silence gives them immense operational flexibility and leaves users with no written contractual protection regarding how their private and public data is used.\n\n2. The Hidden Terms: The Real Rules Are Elsewhere\nObservation: The core terms for the free service are limited to a short list of prohibited actions (spamming, promoting violence, etc.) and a reference to the Privacy Policy. Critical topics like liability, warranties, and dispute resolution are completely absent from the main ToS.\nPlain English Explanation: This ToS is not a complete legal agreement for the core service. Unlike every other major platform, it does not include standard (even if user-hostile) sections on Limitation of Liability, Warranty Disclaimers, or how legal disputes will be handled. This means either these terms are located in another document not easily found, or there are no contractually agreed-upon terms at all, leaving users in a legal limbo with no clear path for recourse if the service fails or causes them harm.\n\n3. The Premium Forfeit Clause: You Lose Everything if You Are Banned\nOriginal Text: \"Failure to comply with the Telegram Terms of Service may result in a temporary or a permanent ban... In such instances, you might lose the benefits of Telegram Premium and we will not compensate you for this loss.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause states that if you are banned from Telegram for violating their rules, you will lose any paid subscription time you have left. They will not provide a refund or any other compensation for the service you paid for but can no longer use.\n\n4. The Service Guarantee Void: No Promise of Availability or Compensation\nOriginal Text: \"Telegram strives to make its services available for all users all the time, but occasional technical issues may occur... Telegram will not compensate you for any direct or indirect loss resulting from our temporary inability to provide any free or paid services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is their version of the \"As Is\" and liability disclaimer, but specifically for service outages. They explicitly state that if their service goes down—even for paid Premium users—they will not compensate you for any losses you suffer as a result. If you rely on Telegram for business or critical communications, you bear all the risk of their technical failures.\n\n5. Third-Party Data Dependency: Core Features Rely on an External Company\nOriginal Text: \"The accuracy and availability of these technologies [transcription and translation] depend on a third party (Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.), and we can not guarantee that they will always be accurate and available.\"\nPlain English Explanation: For key Premium features like transcription and translation, Telegram is not using its own technology. It is sending your data to Google to be processed. While detailed in the Privacy Policy, the ToS confirms that the reliability of these paid features is entirely outside of their control.\n\n6. The Giveaway Liability Dump: If You Run a Giveaway, All Legal Risk is Yours\nOriginal Text: \"If you run a giveaway, you are solely responsible for complying with applicable law. You explicitly acknowledge that Telegram is not liable in the event of sanctions, fees, and any form of legal or administrative action incurred as a result of or in relation to your use of the \"Giveaway\" feature...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Telegram provides a feature for channel owners to run giveaways, but this clause transfers 100% of the legal risk to the user. If a giveaway violates local gambling or promotion laws, the channel owner is solely responsible for all fines, sanctions, and legal consequences. Telegram takes zero responsibility for the use of its own tool.\n\nTelegram's strategy of strategic omission creates legal ambiguity that may be more dangerous than explicit exploitation, as users have no contractual protections or clear legal recourse while the platform maintains maximum operational flexibility.\n\nTransparency Score: 45/100 - High Risk Level\nRed Flags: 6 strategic omission and legal ambiguity mechanisms",

    "url": "https://signal.org/legal/",
    "raw_content": "Signal Terms of Service: The Perfect Counter-Narrative\nRed Flag Analysis - Exemplary Privacy-First Terms\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This document is fundamentally different from every other ToS we have analyzed. It is defined almost entirely by what it lacks: the broad licenses, liability shields, and data-use clauses that are standard elsewhere. Its primary focus is on protecting the service from abuse, not on acquiring rights from the user.\n\nTRANSPARENCY VERDICT: Signal's Terms of Service is the \"sweet poetry\" of legal documents. It is the legal embodiment of a privacy-first, user-centric philosophy. It is short, clear, and defined by the absence of predatory clauses.\n\nKEY FINDING: Signal proves that it is possible to run a global communication service without stripping users of their content ownership, their legal rights, and their dignity. It is the perfect counter-narrative to the idea that \"this is just how the internet has to work.\"\n\nDETAILED ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The \"No Content License\" Clause: The Ultimate Privacy Protection\n\nAnalysis: The document contains NO license grant for your content. It does not ask for a worldwide, perpetual, or transferable license to your messages, photos, or videos.\n\nWhy This Matters: This is the single most important feature of their terms. Because Signal's service is end-to-end encrypted, they cannot access your content. Therefore, they do not—and cannot—ask you for any rights to it. Your content remains yours, and yours alone. This is the legal reflection of their technical architecture.\n\n2. The \"We Don't Have Your Data\" Disclaimer\n\nOriginal Text (from Privacy Policy): \"Signal does not store your messages or any information about your calls on our servers... Signal does not have access to any of this information.\"\n\nEducational Context: Unlike other services that analyze your content for ads or AI training, Signal explicitly states they do not store and cannot access your communications. Their business model (a non-profit) does not require your data, so their legal terms are built around the principle of not having it in the first place.\n\n3. The Standard \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer (A Necessary Evil)\n\nOriginal Text: \"Signal is provided 'as is' without any warranties of any kind... we do not warrant that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.\"\n\nEducational Context: This is a standard clause that every service, even a non-profit, must include for legal protection. It means they provide the service with no legal guarantees that it will always work perfectly or be 100% secure. As a user, you accept the risk of using the service.\n\n4. The Limited Liability Clause (But Without the $100 Cap)\n\nOriginal Text: \"In no event will Signal, its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents, be liable in connection with this agreement or the services for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages... or for any amount in the aggregate that exceeds the amount you paid for the services.\"\n\nWhy This Is Different: Signal limits its liability, but in a much more reasonable way than other platforms. They protect themselves from \"indirect\" damages (like lost profits). Their direct liability is capped at the amount you paid them for the service. Since the service is free and funded by donations (which are not a payment for service), their financial liability is effectively zero, but they achieve this without the predatory-feeling \"$100\" cap.\n\n5. No Forced Arbitration or Class Action Waiver\n\nCritical Observation: The document does NOT contain a mandatory arbitration clause or a class action waiver.\n\nWhy This Is Revolutionary: This is a massive pro-consumer stance. Unlike Microsoft, Meta, and others, Signal does not force you to give up your right to a day in court or your right to join with others in a lawsuit. Legal disputes are handled through the standard court system in California, preserving your fundamental legal rights.\n\n6. A Simple Termination Clause Focused on Abuse\n\nOriginal Text: \"We can suspend or terminate your access to our Services if you violate our Terms of Service or policies, or if we are required to do so by law.\"\n\nEducational Context: Their right to terminate your account is tied directly to you breaking the rules or a legal requirement. Unlike other platforms that reserve the right to ban you for \"any reason or no reason,\" Signal's terms are based on a clear cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nWHAT SIGNAL PROVES:\n\n- Global communication services CAN exist without predatory content licenses\n- Privacy-first architecture leads to privacy-first legal terms\n- Non-profit business models eliminate surveillance capitalism clauses\n- Transparency and simplicity are possible in legal documents\n- Users' legal rights can be preserved while protecting the service\n- Technical design choices directly impact legal terms\n\nTHE COUNTER-NARRATIVE IMPACT:\n\nSignal's Terms of Service demolishes the argument that predatory clauses are \"necessary for modern digital services.\" It proves that when a company's technical architecture and business model are aligned with user privacy, the legal terms naturally become user-friendly.\n\nThis is not an accident—it is the inevitable result of building a service that doesn't need to monetize user data, surveil communications, or claim rights over user content.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE:\n\nSignal serves as the perfect reference point for ToS Salad users. When analyzing other platforms, users can ask:\n- \"Why does Platform X need a perpetual content license when Signal doesn't?\"\n- \"Why does Platform Y force arbitration when Signal allows courts?\"\n- \"Why does Platform Z cap liability at $100 when Signal caps it fairly?\"\n\nSignal proves that a different way is possible. And that is a powerful truth to share.\n\nSource: ToS Salad Transparency Research\nEducational Purpose: Demonstrating that privacy-first, user-centric Terms of Service are possible\nCounter-Narrative: Proof that predatory clauses are not inevitable in digital services",
    "cleaned_content": "Signal Terms of Service: The Perfect Counter-Narrative\nRed Flag Analysis - Exemplary Privacy-First Terms\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This document is fundamentally different from every other ToS we have analyzed. It is defined almost entirely by what it lacks: the broad licenses, liability shields, and data-use clauses that are standard elsewhere. Its primary focus is on protecting the service from abuse, not on acquiring rights from the user.\n\nTRANSPARENCY VERDICT: Signal's Terms of Service is the \"sweet poetry\" of legal documents. It is the legal embodiment of a privacy-first, user-centric philosophy. It is short, clear, and defined by the absence of predatory clauses.\n\nKEY FINDING: Signal proves that it is possible to run a global communication service without stripping users of their content ownership, their legal rights, and their dignity. It is the perfect counter-narrative to the idea that \"this is just how the internet has to work.\"\n\nDETAILED ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The \"No Content License\" Clause: The Ultimate Privacy Protection\n\nAnalysis: The document contains NO license grant for your content. It does not ask for a worldwide, perpetual, or transferable license to your messages, photos, or videos.\n\nWhy This Matters: This is the single most important feature of their terms. Because Signal's service is end-to-end encrypted, they cannot access your content. Therefore, they do not—and cannot—ask you for any rights to it. Your content remains yours, and yours alone. This is the legal reflection of their technical architecture.\n\n2. The \"We Don't Have Your Data\" Disclaimer\n\nOriginal Text (from Privacy Policy): \"Signal does not store your messages or any information about your calls on our servers... Signal does not have access to any of this information.\"\n\nEducational Context: Unlike other services that analyze your content for ads or AI training, Signal explicitly states they do not store and cannot access your communications. Their business model (a non-profit) does not require your data, so their legal terms are built around the principle of not having it in the first place.\n\n3.

    "raw_content": "Chase Bank Terms of Use: Textbook Corporate Predation\nRed Flag Analysis - Surveillance Capitalism Legal Framework\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This document governs the use of Chase's public websites and digital platforms. It is designed to aggressively limit the bank's liability, assert ownership over user-submitted content, and force users into a binding arbitration process that strips them of their fundamental legal rights.\n\nTRANSPARENCY VERDICT: Chase Bank's Terms of Use is a masterclass in corporate legal predation. Every clause is designed to maximize Chase's power while minimizing their responsibility and stripping customers of legal recourse.\n\nKEY FINDING: This analysis is complete evidence of surveillance capitalism's legal infrastructure - a system designed to extract maximum value from users while providing them with minimal protection or rights.\n\nDETAILED PREDATORY CLAUSE ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet: You Forfeit Your Right to a Day in Court\n\nOriginal Text: \"YOU and WE AGREE TO ARBITRATE - ALL DISPUTES... 'Dispute' means any claim, controversy or dispute... 'Dispute' is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced... YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT... YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.\"\n\nPredatory Analysis: This is the most critical and user-hostile clause. By using their website, you permanently give up your right to sue Chase in a traditional court of law before a judge or jury. You are also explicitly forbidden from joining with other customers in a class-action lawsuit. You are forced into a private, binding arbitration system for nearly any dispute, which is a process that overwhelmingly favors the corporation and severely limits your legal power.\n\nWhy This Is Predatory: Forced arbitration systematically favors corporations. Arbitrators are often repeat players with banks, creating financial incentives to rule in favor of the institution that provides them business. Class action waivers prevent customers from pooling resources to challenge systemic abuse.\n\n2. The \"Submissions\" Clause: Your Ideas and Content Become Their Property, For Free\n\nOriginal Text: \"...any remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, or other information that you communicate to us through this site... become our property. This means that... we don't have to treat any such submission as confidential. You can't sue us for using the ideas you submit. If we use them, or anything like them, we don't have to pay you or anyone else for them. We will have the exclusive ownership of all present and future rights to submissions of any kind.\"\n\nPredatory Analysis: This is an incredibly aggressive \"your ideas are ours\" clause. Any suggestion, idea, or feedback you provide to Chase immediately becomes their exclusive property. They can use it, patent it, build products from it, and profit from it, and they explicitly state that they owe you nothing and you cannot sue them for it. You are effectively providing them with free consulting and intellectual property.\n\nWhy This Is Predatory: This goes far beyond protecting the company from frivolous lawsuits. It's intellectual property theft disguised as legal protection. Users who provide feedback to improve services become unpaid consultants whose ideas can be monetized without compensation.\n\n3. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Any Damages\n\nOriginal Text: \"WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR INJURIES... INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES... THESE INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO) DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ANY... FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY... COMPUTER VIRUS, OR LINE FAILURE.\"\n\nPredatory Analysis: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. It states that Chase will not be held legally or financially responsible for any damages you suffer from using their website, for any reason. Even if a flaw, error, or computer virus on their own site causes you direct financial loss or damages your computer, this clause is designed to ensure they cannot be held liable.\n\nWhy This Is Predatory: This attempts to eliminate all accountability for negligence. Even if Chase's own errors cause financial harm to customers, they claim no responsibility. This shifts all risk to users while Chase retains all control.\n\n4. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: The Site is Not Guaranteed to be Safe or Accurate\n\nOriginal Text: \"THE MATERIALS IN OUR SITES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS'... THIS MEANS THAT WE DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES... THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES... THAT THE SITE IS OF ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF QUALITY, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURATE, AND ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE SITE IS SECURE AND NON-INFRINGING.\"\n\nPredatory Analysis: Chase makes zero legal promises about the quality, accuracy, or security of its own websites. They explicitly state they do not guarantee the site is error-free or secure. By using their site, you, the customer, assume 100% of the risk that the information is wrong or that the site itself could be unsafe.\n\nWhy This Is Predatory: A bank disclaiming responsibility for the security and accuracy of their own financial website is breathtaking in its audacity. They want customers to trust them with their money while legally disclaiming any responsibility for providing secure, accurate services.\n\n5. The Unilateral Control Clause: They Can Terminate Your Access at Any Time\n\nOriginal Text: \"J.P. Morgan Chase reserves the right to suspend or deny, in its sole discretion, your access to all or any portion of the Site with or without notice.\"\n\nPredatory Analysis: This gives Chase the absolute right to block you from accessing their websites and your online accounts at any time, for any reason they choose, without having to provide you with any advance warning or explanation. Your access is a privilege that they can revoke at their sole discretion.\n\nWhy This Is Predatory: This creates a power imbalance where customers can be cut off from their own financial information without explanation or recourse. It's digital financial censorship disguised as platform management.\n\n6. The Monitoring Clause: They Can Watch and Record Your Actions\n\nOriginal Text: \"We may monitor your use of this site, and may freely use and disclose any information and materials received from you or collected through your use of the site for any lawful reason or purpose.\"\n\nPredatory Analysis: This clause grants Chase the right to monitor everything you do on their website. It further states that they can use and disclose any information they collect from your activity for any legal reason they see fit. This provides them with a broad license to use your behavioral data, which is further detailed in their separate privacy policies.\n\nWhy This Is Predatory: This enables comprehensive surveillance of customer behavior for profit. \"Any lawful reason\" is deliberately broad, allowing data monetization, behavioral profiling, and third-party sharing.\n\nSURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS:\n\nChase's Terms of Use exemplifies the legal infrastructure of surveillance capitalism:\n\n• Data Extraction: Broad monitoring and data collection rights\n• Value Appropriation: Free intellectual property acquisition from user submissions\n• Risk Socialization: All liability transferred to users\n• Power Concentration: Unilateral termination and control rights\n• Legal Immunity: Forced arbitration eliminates democratic accountability\n\nTHE SIGNAL COUNTER-NARRATIVE COMPARISON:\n\nSignal's Terms of Service: ✅ No content licenses, ✅ Court access preserved, ✅ Minimal liability caps, ✅ No monitoring clauses\n\nChase Bank's Terms of Use: ❌ Steals your ideas, ❌ Forces arbitration, ❌ Zero liability, ❌ Comprehensive surveillance\n\nWHAT CHASE REVEALS ABOUT SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM:\n\nChase proves that predatory terms are not about providing services - they're about extracting maximum value while providing minimum accountability. Every clause is designed to benefit Chase at the customer's expense.\n\nThis is surveillance capitalism's legal playbook: monitor everything, own everything, control everything, while being responsible for nothing.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE:\n\nChase serves as the perfect example of what to avoid. When users see:\n- Forced arbitration clauses\n- Broad intellectual property grabs\n- Absolute liability disclaimers\n- Unilateral termination rights\n- Comprehensive monitoring permissions\n\nThey should ask: \"Why does this company need these powers over me?\"\n\nThe answer is always the same: Because surveillance capitalism requires legal frameworks that prioritize corporate extraction over human rights.\n\nSource: ToS Salad Transparency Research\nEducational Purpose: Exposing surveillance capitalism's legal infrastructure\nWarning: Textbook example of predatory corporate terms designed to maximize institutional power",

    "url": "https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement",
    "raw_content": "Reddit User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis\nBelow are analyses of significant clauses from Reddit's User Agreement. This is not an exhaustive list but highlights key terms that impact a user's rights, data, and content.\n\n1. Content Licensing: Granting Reddit Sweeping Rights to Your Content\nOriginal Text: \"When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause describes the broad permissions you give Reddit for anything you post. This means that while you still own your content, you grant Reddit a permanent and irreversible license to use, modify, distribute, and even sell or transfer that content to others, anywhere in the world, without ever paying you.\n\n2. AI Training: Explicit Permission to Use Your Content for AI\nOriginal Text: \"This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. For example, this license includes the right to use Your Content to train AI and machine learning models, as further described in our Public Content Policy.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This explicitly states that Reddit can use everything you post—your comments, stories, and images—to train artificial intelligence systems. It also confirms they can provide your content to their partners for publication or other uses.\n\n3. Waiver of Rights: Giving Up Credit and Control\nOriginal Text: \"You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means Reddit can use your content without giving you credit (attribution). You also permanently give up your \"moral rights,\" which in some legal systems protect a creator's work from being used in a way that harms their reputation.\n\n4. Indemnification: You Are Financially Responsible for Reddit's Legal Problems\nOriginal Text: \"Except to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Reddit... harmless from and against any claim or demand made by any third party... due to, arising out of, or in connection with: ... (d) Your Content.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means that if someone sues Reddit because of something you posted, you are legally required to pay for Reddit's lawyers and any damages awarded. You take on the financial and legal responsibility for how your content impacts Reddit.\n\n5. Limitation of Liability: Capping Reddit's Responsibility to $100\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE REDDIT ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100) OR ANY AMOUNT YOU PAID REDDIT IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes that if Reddit's actions cause you harm (for instance, through a major data breach), the absolute maximum amount of money you can claim in damages from them is $100 (unless you've paid them for services).\n\n6. \"As Is\" Service: No Guarantee of Safety or Reliability\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND... REDDIT DOES NOT CONTROL, ENDORSE, OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR LINKED TO THE SERVICES OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR USER, INCLUDING MODERATORS.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means Reddit provides the service with no promises that it will be safe, functional, or error-free. They are not legally responsible for what users post or what volunteer moderators do, even if the content is illegal or harmful.\n\n7. Termination: Reddit Can Ban You for Any Reason, or No Reason\nOriginal Text: \"To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may suspend or terminate your Account, moderator status, or ability to access or use the Services at any time for any or no reason, including for violating these Terms or our Reddit Rules.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Reddit the right to delete your account or ban you from the service at their discretion. They do not need to provide a reason for the termination.\n\n8. Governing Law and Venue: You Must Sue in California\nOriginal Text: \"...all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and Reddit consent to personal jurisdiction in these courts.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means that if you have a legal dispute with Reddit, you must file your lawsuit in San Francisco, California, regardless of where in the world you live. This can make taking legal action costly and difficult for most users.",
    "cleaned_content": "Reddit User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis\nBelow are analyses of significant clauses from Reddit's User Agreement. This is not an exhaustive list but highlights key terms that impact a user's rights, data, and content.\n\n1. Content Licensing: Granting Reddit Sweeping Rights to Your Content\nOriginal Text: \"When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause describes the broad permissions you give Reddit for anything you post. This means that while you still own your content, you grant Reddit a permanent and irreversible license to use, modify, distribute, and even sell or transfer that content to others, anywhere in the world, without ever paying you.\n\n2. AI Training: Explicit Permission to Use Your Content for AI\nOriginal Text: \"This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. For example, this license includes the right to use Your Content to train AI and machine learning models, as further described in our Public Content Policy.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This explicitly states that Reddit can use everything you post—your comments, stories, and images—to train artificial intelligence systems. It also confirms they can provide your content to their partners for publication or other uses.\n\n3. Waiver of Rights: Giving Up Credit and Control\nOriginal Text: \"You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means Reddit can use your content without giving you credit (attribution). You also permanently give up your \"moral rights,\" which in some legal systems protect a creator's work from being used in a way that harms their reputation.\n\n4. Indemnification: You Are Financially Responsible for Reddit's Legal Problems\nOriginal Text: \"Except to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Reddit... harmless from and against any claim or demand made by any third party... due to, arising out of, or in connection with: ... (d) Your Content.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means that if someone sues Reddit because of something you posted, you are legally required to pay for Reddit's lawyers and any damages awarded. You take on the financial and legal responsibility for how your content impacts Reddit.\n\n5. Limitation of Liability: Capping Reddit's Responsibility to $100\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE REDDIT ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100) OR ANY AMOUNT YOU PAID REDDIT IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This describes that if Reddit's actions cause you harm (for instance, through a major data breach), the absolute maximum amount of money you can claim in damages from them is $100 (unless you've paid them for services).\n\n6. \"As Is\" Service: No Guarantee of Safety or Reliability\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND... REDDIT DOES NOT CONTROL, ENDORSE, OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR LINKED TO THE SERVICES OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR USER, INCLUDING MODERATORS.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means Reddit provides the service with no promises that it will be safe, functional, or error-free. They are not legally responsible for what users post or what volunteer moderators do, even if the content is illegal or harmful.\n\n7. Termination: Reddit Can Ban You for Any Reason, or No Reason\nOriginal Text: \"To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may suspend or terminate your Account, moderator status, or ability to access or use the Services at any time for any or no reason, including for violating these Terms or our Reddit Rules.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Reddit the right to delete your account or ban you from the service at their discretion. They do not need to provide a reason for the termination.\n\n8. Governing Law and Venue: You Must Sue in California\nOriginal Text: \"...all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and Reddit consent to personal jurisdiction in these courts.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This means that if you have a legal dispute with Reddit, you must file your lawsuit in San Francisco, California, regardless of where in the world you live.

    "raw_content": "Reddit User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 18/100\nJustification: This agreement is designed to maximize Reddit's legal protection while minimizing user rights. It combines aggressive content licensing with forced arbitration, complete liability disclaimers, and unilateral control over user accounts. The low score reflects Reddit's systematic approach to extracting maximum value from user content while providing minimal protections or recourse for users. The agreement is particularly hostile to content creators who generate the valuable discussions that drive the platform.\n\n1. The \"We Own Everything You Post\" License: Perpetual, Irrevocable Rights to All User Content\nOriginal Text: \"By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights. You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content: When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is one of the most aggressive content licensing clauses in social media. When you post anything on Reddit—comments, posts, images, videos—you grant them permanent, irrevocable rights to use, modify, and distribute that content forever, even if you delete your account. They can sell your content to AI companies, use it in advertising, or create derivative works without ever paying you. The \"transferable and sublicensable\" language means they can sell these rights to other companies. You are essentially working for free to create Reddit's most valuable asset: user-generated content.\n\n2. Forced Arbitration: You Cannot Sue Reddit in Court\nOriginal Text: \"Any Dispute between you and Reddit will be resolved through binding individual arbitration... You and Reddit agree that any Dispute will be settled solely by binding individual arbitration and not in a class action, representative action, or other similar proceeding... THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT... YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND REDDIT MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause removes your right to sue Reddit in public court and prevents class action lawsuits. Instead, you must use private arbitration, which is expensive, secretive, and historically favors corporations. If Reddit violates your rights, steals your content, or causes you harm, you cannot join with other users in a class action lawsuit. You must fight them alone, in private, with an arbitrator that corporations typically prefer. This effectively shields Reddit from most legal accountability.\n\n3. Complete Liability Shield: Reddit is Not Responsible for Any Damages\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, WILL REDDIT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES... REDDIT'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO REDDIT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means Reddit accepts almost zero legal responsibility for any harm their platform causes you. If their platform spreads misinformation that damages your reputation, if a data breach exposes your personal information, if their algorithm promotes harassment against you, or if their negligence causes you financial loss—their maximum liability is $100 or what you paid them (often $0). This transfers all the risk of using their platform from them to you.\n\n4. Unilateral Account Termination: They Can Delete Your Account and Content Anytime\nOriginal Text: \"Reddit may terminate or suspend your Reddit account or ability to access or use the Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms... Upon termination of your account, your right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. Termination of your account does not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability you may have to Reddit or any third party.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit can delete your account, and years of posts and comments, at any time for any reason without warning. If you've built a following or used Reddit for business networking, they can destroy that with no recourse. Even after termination, you're still bound by their terms (like the content license), but they have no obligations to you. This gives them ultimate power over your digital presence on their platform.\n\n5. Unlimited Right to Change Terms: They Can Rewrite the Rules Anytime\nOriginal Text: \"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the revised Terms and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services... By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit can change these terms at any time, and your continued use means you automatically agree to whatever new terms they create. They can decide what constitutes \"material\" changes and whether to notify you. This means the agreement you thought you were signing could be completely different tomorrow, and you have no choice but to accept it or stop using the platform entirely.\n\n6. No Warranty on Service Quality: Reddit Provides No Guarantees\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT... REDDIT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit makes no promises that their service will work, be secure, or be available when you need it. If the platform goes down during important discussions, if security flaws expose your data, or if bugs cause you to lose content, they have no legal obligation to fix these problems or compensate you for any losses.\n\n7. User Content Responsibility Shift: You're Liable for Everything, They're Liable for Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"You are solely responsible for Your Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it... Reddit takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Content posted, stored, uploaded, or otherwise made available by you or any third party.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause makes you legally responsible for everything you post, but makes Reddit responsible for nothing that appears on their platform. If someone posts defamatory content about you, Reddit isn't liable. If you accidentally violate someone's copyright, you're fully liable even though Reddit profits from hosting that content. This creates a one-way liability structure where users bear all the legal risks while Reddit reaps all the benefits.\n\n8. Data Collection and Sharing: Broad Rights to Monitor and Monetize User Activity\nOriginal Text: \"We may use information about you to... provide, maintain, and improve the Services; research and develop new services; send you technical notices, security alerts, and administrative messages; communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This gives Reddit expansive rights to collect, analyze, and use your personal data for their business purposes. They can monitor your activity patterns, interests, and behaviors to build detailed profiles for advertising. While they claim to anonymize data, the combination of posting history, voting patterns, and engagement data can create highly specific user profiles that have significant commercial value.\n\nThe Reddit User Agreement represents a systematic approach to maximizing platform value while minimizing corporate responsibility, creating a fundamentally imbalanced relationship between the platform and its content-creating users.\n\nTransparency Score: 18/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 8 systematic user exploitation issues",

The low score reflects Reddit's systematic approach to extracting maximum value from user content while providing minimal protections or recourse for users. The agreement is particularly hostile to content creators who generate the valuable discussions that drive the platform.\n\n1. The \"We Own Everything You Post\" License: Perpetual, Irrevocable Rights to All User Content\nOriginal Text: \"By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights. You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content: When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is one of the most aggressive content licensing clauses in social media. When you post anything on Reddit—comments, posts, images, videos—you grant them permanent, irrevocable rights to use, modify, and distribute that content forever, even if you delete your account. They can sell your content to AI companies, use it in advertising, or create derivative works without ever paying you. The \"transferable and sublicensable\" language means they can sell these rights to other companies. You are essentially working for free to create Reddit's most valuable asset: user-generated content.\n\n2. Forced Arbitration: You Cannot Sue Reddit in Court\nOriginal Text: \"Any Dispute between you and Reddit will be resolved through binding individual arbitration... You and Reddit agree that any Dispute will be settled solely by binding individual arbitration and not in a class action, representative action, or other similar proceeding... THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT... YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND REDDIT MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause removes your right to sue Reddit in public court and prevents class action lawsuits. Instead, you must use private arbitration, which is expensive, secretive, and historically favors corporations. If Reddit violates your rights, steals your content, or causes you harm, you cannot join with other users in a class action lawsuit. You must fight them alone, in private, with an arbitrator that corporations typically prefer. This effectively shields Reddit from most legal accountability.\n\n3. Complete Liability Shield: Reddit is Not Responsible for Any Damages\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, WILL REDDIT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES... REDDIT'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO REDDIT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause means Reddit accepts almost zero legal responsibility for any harm their platform causes you. If their platform spreads misinformation that damages your reputation, if a data breach exposes your personal information, if their algorithm promotes harassment against you, or if their negligence causes you financial loss—their maximum liability is $100 or what you paid them (often $0). This transfers all the risk of using their platform from them to you.\n\n4. Unilateral Account Termination: They Can Delete Your Account and Content Anytime\nOriginal Text: \"Reddit may terminate or suspend your Reddit account or ability to access or use the Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms... Upon termination of your account, your right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. Termination of your account does not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability you may have to Reddit or any third party.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit can delete your account, and years of posts and comments, at any time for any reason without warning. If you've built a following or used Reddit for business networking, they can destroy that with no recourse. Even after termination, you're still bound by their terms (like the content license), but they have no obligations to you. This gives them ultimate power over your digital presence on their platform.\n\n5. Unlimited Right to Change Terms: They Can Rewrite the Rules Anytime\nOriginal Text: \"We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the revised Terms and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services... By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit can change these terms at any time, and your continued use means you automatically agree to whatever new terms they create. They can decide what constitutes \"material\" changes and whether to notify you. This means the agreement you thought you were signing could be completely different tomorrow, and you have no choice but to accept it or stop using the platform entirely.\n\n6. No Warranty on Service Quality: Reddit Provides No Guarantees\nOriginal Text: \"THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT... REDDIT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Reddit makes no promises that their service will work, be secure, or be available when you need it. If the platform goes down during important discussions, if security flaws expose your data, or if bugs cause you to lose content, they have no legal obligation to fix these problems or compensate you for any losses.\n\n7. User Content Responsibility Shift: You're Liable for Everything, They're Liable for Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"You are solely responsible for Your Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it... Reddit takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Content posted, stored, uploaded, or otherwise made available by you or any third party.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause makes you legally responsible for everything you post, but makes Reddit responsible for nothing that appears on their platform. If someone posts defamatory content about you, Reddit isn't liable. If you accidentally violate someone's copyright, you're fully liable even though Reddit profits from hosting that content. This creates a one-way liability structure where users bear all the legal risks while Reddit reaps all the benefits.\n\n8. Data Collection and Sharing: Broad Rights to Monitor and Monetize User Activity\nOriginal Text: \"We may use information about you to... provide, maintain, and improve the Services; research and develop new services; send you technical notices, security alerts, and administrative messages; communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This gives Reddit expansive rights to collect, analyze, and use your personal data for their business purposes. They can monitor your activity patterns, interests, and behaviors to build detailed profiles for advertising. While they claim to anonymize data, the combination of posting history, voting patterns, and engagement data can create highly specific user profiles that have significant commercial value.\n\nThe Reddit User Agreement represents a systematic approach to maximizing platform value while minimizing corporate responsibility, creating a fundamentally imbalanced relationship between the platform and its content-creating users.\n\nTransparency Score: 18/100 - Critical Risk Level\nRed Flags: 8 systematic user exploitation issues",

    "raw_content": "Spotify for Creators Terms: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 40/100\nJustification: While this is a B2B agreement, it employs many of the same user-hostile tactics as the consumer ToS. It grants Spotify a sweeping, perpetual license to artist content and feedback, forces artists into binding individual arbitration (a severe limitation for a business), and contains aggressive liability shields. It is less transparent than a standard B2B agreement should be, as it strips creators of fundamental legal recourse that businesses typically retain.\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet (for Businesses): You Cannot Sue Spotify in Court\nOriginal Text: \"Any dispute... arising out of or relating in any way to these Creator Terms... shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration... WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most critical and predatory clause for an artist or creator. Just like with consumers, Spotify forbids you from suing them in a real court. You are also banned from joining with other artists in a class-action lawsuit to address widespread issues (like payment discrepancies or policy changes). This severely weakens the power of independent creators and forces them into a costly, private, individual arbitration process against a massive corporation.\n\n2. The \"Everything You Give Us is Ours\" License: Sweeping Rights to Your Content and Ideas\nOriginal Text: \"You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public, publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content... If you provide ideas, suggestions, or other feedback... you grant Spotify an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to use the Feedback...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a two-pronged \"God License.\" First, for any content you upload directly through the service (like a podcast episode, playlist art, or profile info), you grant Spotify a permanent, free, worldwide license to use and modify it. Second, and more aggressively, any idea or suggestion you provide becomes their property to use and profit from forever, without paying you or giving you credit.\n\n3. The \"We Own the Data\" Clause: You Don't Own Your Audience Analytics\nOriginal Text: \"As between you and Spotify, Spotify owns all data that Spotify makes available to you through Spotify for Creators... You may only use the data... for your own internal informational purposes... You may not... authorize any third party to access or use the data for any purpose, including for advertising or ad-targeting, or to build a profile of any Spotify user.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Spotify provides creators with analytics about their listeners. This clause makes it clear that you do not own this data. Spotify owns it. You are only allowed to view it for your own information. You are explicitly forbidden from exporting this data to use with other services, to sell to advertisers, or to build your own understanding of your audience outside of Spotify's platform. They control your access to your own listener data.\n\n4. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Damages\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT WILL SPOTIFY, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES... BE LIABLE FOR (1) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (2) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT)...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. If a failure by Spotify (like a technical glitch that makes your new album unavailable on release day, or a data error that misreports your streams) causes you to lose profits, business opportunities, or data, they will not be held legally or financially responsible for those \"indirect\" or \"consequential\" damages. This transfers enormous business risk from the platform to the creator.\n\n5. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: No Guarantee of a Functional Service\nOriginal Text: \"THE SPOTIFY SERVICE AND SPOTIFY FOR CREATORS ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE,' WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND... SPOTIFY AND ALL OWNERS OF CONTENT DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENT...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Spotify makes no legal promises that their creator tools will work correctly, be accurate, or be available when you need them. If their analytics are wrong, if their upload tools fail, or if their platform has security flaws, you have accepted that risk by agreeing to these terms.\n\n6. The Shortened Time to Sue: One Year to File a Claim\nOriginal Text: \"You and Spotify agree that any arbitration shall be commenced within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action. For any dispute, you must begin the arbitration process within one year of discovering the issue, or you permanently lose all rights to do so. This can be a significant hurdle for complex issues like long-term royalty accounting errors.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document reveals a significant power imbalance, using consumer-style legal tactics against business partners (the creators) to limit their rights and Spotify's own accountability.\n\nTransparency Score: 40/100 - Business-Hostile B2B Agreement\nRed Flags: 6 systematic creator exploitation issues",

    "raw_content": "Verizon Terms of Service (Combined Analysis): Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 15/100\nJustification: This legal framework is a masterclass in corporate self-protection at the direct expense of the consumer. It employs nearly every user-hostile clause possible: mandatory binding arbitration, a complete waiver of class-action rights, aggressive liability caps, sweeping disclaimers of service quality, and broad rights to monitor and use customer data. The complexity, cross-referencing between multiple documents, and the sheer scope of the rights being waived place it firmly in the \"horror movie\" category of corporate legal agreements.\n\n1. The Ironclad Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: You Have No Right to a Day in Court, Ever\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND VERIZION BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT... YOU'RE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the foundational clause of the entire agreement, repeated in multiple documents. By using Verizon's service, you permanently and completely waive your right to sue them in a traditional court of law. More importantly, you are explicitly forbidden from joining with other customers in a class-action lawsuit. This is the single most powerful tool a corporation has to prevent widespread accountability for issues like billing errors, data breaches, or service failures.\n\n2. The Absolute Disclaimer of Warranties: They Guarantee Absolutely Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose... WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES... WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Verizon makes zero legal promises that their service—the internet and phone connectivity you pay for—will actually work. They do not guarantee it will be reliable, secure, or free from errors. By signing up, you legally accept that you are paying for a service that comes with no guarantees of quality or security, and you bear all the risk of its failure.\n\n3. The Aggressive Limitation of Liability: If Their Failure Causes You Massive Harm, They Are Not Responsible\nOriginal Text: \"VERIZON... [IS] NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND... INCLUDING LOST PROFITS (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT SUCH LOSS MAY OCCUR)...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad liability shield. If an outage of Verizon's service causes your home business to lose thousands of dollars, or if a failure in their system leads to other major damages, they are not legally or financially responsible for those losses. This clause is specifically designed to protect them from paying for the real-world consequences of their service failures.\n\n4. The Data Monitoring and Sharing Clause: They Watch What You Do and Share It\nOriginal Text: \"You agree that Verizon and its third-party service providers have a right to... access your computer and any other device... to monitor, from time to time, your content, and your bandwidth, transmissions and usage to... prevent a breach of these terms... We may also... use, copy, display, store, transmit and reformat data as necessary to provide the Services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause grants Verizon broad rights to monitor your internet activity. They can access your devices, monitor your bandwidth, and analyze your usage patterns. This is framed as a necessity for network management, but it provides them with deep insights into your online behavior, which they can use and share as \"necessary to provide the Services.\"\n\n5. The Automatic Enrollment in \"Verizon Up\": Your Data is Used for Advertising by Default\nOriginal Text (from Entertainment Play Legal): \"By enrolling in a Plan that includes Verizon Up, you are accepting these Verizon Up Terms and Conditions... We and our partners may also use information about you and your activity... to provide you with marketing and advertising about other products and services.\"\nPlain English Explanation: When you sign up for many of Verizon's plans, you are automatically enrolled in their \"Verizon Up\" rewards program. This clause confirms that by accepting the plan, you are also agreeing to have your data (including location, web browsing, and app usage data as detailed in their privacy policy) used by Verizon and its partners to target you with advertising.\n\n6. The Unilateral \"Changes\" Clause: They Can Change the Contract Whenever They Want\nOriginal Text: \"We may change these Terms of Use, the Services, and/or any prices, fees and other charges at any time. Your continued use of the Services... will mean that you accept any new or changed terms and conditions.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Verizon reserves the absolute right to change the terms of your contract, including the price, at any time. Your only choice is to accept the new terms by continuing to use the service, or to cancel. This creates a one-sided relationship where the terms you originally agreed to are never permanent.\n\n7. The Software License Clause: They Can Install and Modify Software on Your Devices\nOriginal Text: \"You agree to allow us and our agents the right to install, access, and/or use the Software on your Equipment... without any further notice or consent... you authorize us to update, upgrade or otherwise modify the Software... at any time, and in our sole discretion...\"\nPlain English Explanation: For services that require their software (like on a set-top box or router), this clause gives Verizon the right to install and change that software whenever they want, without asking your permission each time. This gives them a persistent presence and control over the equipment in your home.\n\nThis is the complete analysis for the combined Verizon legal framework.",

    "raw_content": "LinkedIn User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 25/100\nJustification: While professionally formatted and clearly written, this agreement is fundamentally user-hostile in its core legal structure. It grants LinkedIn a sweeping, perpetual license to user content (which includes professional articles, posts, and resumes), completely disclaims all warranties, and severely limits its own liability. Most critically, it does not use forced arbitration, which is a major positive. However, it replaces it with a \"home court\" clause that is nearly as effective at preventing legal challenges. The low score reflects the vast power imbalance it creates in a professional context where users often have no alternative.\n\n1. The \"Everything You Post is Ours to Use\" License: A Sweeping, Perpetual Right to Your Professional Content\nOriginal Text: \"You grant LinkedIn a worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process, information and content that you provide through our Services... without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others... This license is... perpetual and irrevocable.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the foundational clause. Any content you post on LinkedIn—your resume, articles you write, professional updates, comments—you grant them a permanent, irreversible, free license to use, copy, modify, and distribute it. They can sell this data to others (\"transferable and sublicensable\") without ever paying you or asking for your permission again. You are providing the high-value professional content that powers their platform for free.\n\n2. The \"We Are Not Liable for Anything\" Clause: A Total Disclaimer of Responsibility\nOriginal Text: \"LINKEDIN... DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR... LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, REVENUES OR REPUTATION...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad liability shield. If a failure by LinkedIn causes you to lose your entire professional network, critical data, or if a data breach harms your professional reputation and costs you a job, they are not legally or financially responsible for those damages. This transfers the entire professional risk of using their platform from them to you.\n\n3. The \"No Warranty\" Disclaimer: The Service is Not Guaranteed to Work or Be Accurate\nOriginal Text: \"LINKEDIN... DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE... AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' BASIS.\"\nPlain English Explanation: LinkedIn makes no legal promises that its service will work, be available, or that the information on it (including job postings or profiles) is accurate. They provide the platform with no guarantees. If you rely on their platform for your career and it fails or contains errors, you have accepted that risk.\n\n4. The \"Home Court Advantage\" (Instead of Arbitration): You Must Sue in California or Ireland\nOriginal Text: \"For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live in the United States, you and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A... shall govern all claims... you and LinkedIn agree that all such claims can only be litigated in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critically important clause. LinkedIn does not use forced arbitration, which is a major point in their favor. However, they replace it with this \"forum selection\" clause. It forces any user in the US to file their lawsuit in Santa Clara County, California. For the vast majority of users, the cost and logistical difficulty of doing this is so high that it serves the same purpose as an arbitration clause: it effectively prevents most legal challenges.\n\n5. Unilateral Control: They Can Change, Suspend, or End the Service at Any Time\nOriginal Text: \"We may change or discontinue any of our Services. We don't promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you've posted... LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law...\"\nPlain English Explanation: LinkedIn has the absolute right to change or shut down its services at any time. More importantly, they explicitly state they are not a storage service and have no obligation to save your data. If they decide to delete your content, your professional network, or your entire profile, this clause states they have the right to do so. You are responsible for keeping your own backups.\n\n6. The Right to Terminate Your Account at Will\nOriginal Text: \"LinkedIn can end this Contract at any time. We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you are in breach of this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives LinkedIn the right to terminate your professional online identity on their platform if they believe you have violated their rules. Given the importance of LinkedIn in many industries, this gives them significant power over a user's career prospects and professional network.\n\nThis analysis is complete. While the absence of a forced arbitration clause is a significant and positive distinction, the agreement is still built to give the platform maximum control and minimum liability, creating a substantial power imbalance with the professional user.",

    "url": "https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/",
    "raw_content": "Spotify Terms of Use (Consumer): Key Clause Analysis\n\nThis document establishes a legal framework that grants users a limited license to access the service while requiring them to waive significant legal rights, particularly the right to participate in class-action lawsuits. It also aggressively limits Spotify's liability for any harm caused by their service.\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration Gauntlet & Class Action Waiver: You Forfeit Your Right to Group Legal Action\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT... ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY... WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION... YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most critical rights-stripping clause in the agreement. You are forbidden from suing Spotify in a traditional court and are banned from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. You are forced into an individual, private arbitration process. This is a powerful tool to prevent consumers from holding the company accountable for widespread issues, as it makes legal challenges significantly more difficult and expensive for individuals.\n\n2. The Liability Cap: If Spotify Fails, They Owe You Almost Nothing\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT WILL SPOTIFY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY... EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SPOTIFY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST CLAIM; OR (B) .00.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause severely limits Spotify's financial responsibility. If a failure on their part (like a major data breach of your personal information and listening habits) causes you significant harm, the absolute maximum financial compensation they will be liable for is fifty dollars or the fees you paid them in the last year. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for their potential failures.\n\n3. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: The Service is Not Guaranteed to Work or Be Safe\nOriginal Text: \"THE SPOTIFY SERVICE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE,' WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. FURTHER, SPOTIFY AND ALL OWNERS OF THE CONTENT DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENT, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Spotify makes no legal promises about the quality, reliability, or security of its service. They do not guarantee that it will work without errors or be secure. By using the service, you accept all the risk of its potential failures, including the risk that the content you stream could be unavailable or that the app itself could have security flaws.\n\n4. The Unilateral \"Changes\" Clause: They Can Change the Deal at Any Time\nOriginal Text: \"Spotify may, from time to time, make changes to these Terms... When we make material changes to these Terms, we'll provide you with notice as appropriate... Your continued use of the Spotify Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the new version of the Terms, you may terminate your account...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Spotify can change its legal agreement with you at any time. Your only choice is to accept the new rules by continuing to listen to music, or to reject them by deleting your account. This makes the contract a living document that you are perpetually agreeing to, often without realizing the terms have changed.\n\n5. Third-Party Risk Dump: If a Linked Service Harms You, It's Not Spotify's Problem\nOriginal Text: \"The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third-party applications, websites, and services... and third-party devices... These Third-Party Applications, Devices and Services are not part of the Spotify Service... and Spotify is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third-Party Application, Device or Service...\"\nPlain English Explanation: The Spotify app connects to many other services (like Instagram, Sonos speakers, etc.). This clause states that if one of those third-party services malfunctions, steals your data, or causes you harm, Spotify takes zero responsibility. You are on your own to resolve the issue with the other company.\n\n6. The \"User Guidelines\" Enforcement: They Can Terminate Your Account for Vague Reasons\nOriginal Text: \"Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same... The following is not permitted for any reason whatsoever:... circumventing any technology used by Spotify, its licensors, or any third party to protect the Content or the Service... Spotify may, in its sole discretion, terminate your Spotify account, or suspend your access to the Spotify Service.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Spotify the right to terminate your account at their discretion if they believe you have violated their rules, which include broad prohibitions. This gives them significant power to remove a user from the platform based on their own interpretation of the user's actions.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a standard-issue consumer tech ToS, built on a foundation of forced arbitration and severely limited liability.",

    "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/terms/",
    "raw_content": "GitLab Terms of Use: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 65/100\nJustification: GitLab's ToS is a notable and positive outlier in the tech industry, primarily for two massive reasons: it lacks a forced arbitration clause and a class action waiver. This preserves the fundamental legal rights of its users, which is a rare and commendable choice. It also makes a clear and fair distinction between \"Your Content\" (your code, which you own) and \"Feedback\" (your ideas, which they own). However, it still employs the industry-standard, user-hostile clauses for limiting its own liability, disclaiming all warranties, and forcing all legal disputes into its home court of California. It is a significantly more transparent and fair document than the industry average, but it is still a corporate contract designed to shield the company from risk.\n\n1. No Forced Arbitration or Class Action Waiver: You Retain Your Right to a Day in Court\nObservation: The document does not contain a mandatory binding arbitration clause or a class action waiver. This is a profound and positive exception to the industry norm.\nPlain English Explanation: This is the single most user-friendly aspect of GitLab's terms. Unlike almost every other major tech platform, GitLab does not force you to give up your right to sue them in a traditional court of law. It also does not forbid you from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. This preserves your fundamental legal rights and is a significant sign of good faith.\n\n2. The \"Home Court Advantage\": The Catch to No Arbitration\nOriginal Text: \"...any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the licenses granted hereunder shall be instituted exclusively in the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the trade-off for not having forced arbitration. While you can sue GitLab, you are legally required to do it in their backyard of San Francisco. For most users and small businesses located outside of California, the immense cost and logistical difficulty of filing a lawsuit there makes this a powerful deterrent, effectively discouraging most legal challenges.\n\n3. The Content License: A Reasonable and Purpose-Bound Grant\nOriginal Text: \"...you grant GitLab a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid up, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, host, reproduce, display, perform, modify... Your Content for the purpose of operating, improving, and providing the Site and Services to you.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause defines the rights you give GitLab to your code and other content. While the license is broad, it is critically limited by a purpose clause: \"for the purpose of operating, improving, and providing the Site and Services.\" This is much better than the open-ended licenses of social media platforms, as it ties their rights directly to the service they are providing you. You own your code; you are just giving them the necessary permissions to host it for you.\n\n4. The \"Feedback vs. Content\" Distinction: They Own Your Ideas, You Own Your Code\nOriginal Text: \"As to any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests... or other feedback you provide to GitLab... you grant GitLab... a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license... to use and exploit the Feedback in any manner...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a crucial distinction. The document separates \"Your Content\" (your code) from \"Feedback\" (your suggestions about their platform). While you retain ownership of your code, this clause states that any idea or suggestion you give them becomes their property to use and profit from forever, without paying you or giving you credit.\n\n5. The Aggressive Liability Cap: The Standard  Limit\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT WILL GITLAB'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY... EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU... DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT... OR (II) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ().\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the standard but predatory liability cap. If a catastrophic failure at GitLab—such as the permanent deletion of your company's entire codebase—destroys your business, the absolute maximum financial responsibility they accept is  or the fees you paid in the previous year. This places almost all the business risk on the user.\n\n6. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: No Guarantee of a Functional or Secure Service\nOriginal Text: \"THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS. GITLAB MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE... INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT...\"\nPlain English Explanation: GitLab makes zero legal promises that its service will work, be reliable, or be secure. They do not guarantee your code will be safe from breaches or that the service will be available when you need it. By using the platform, you legally accept 100% of the risk of its potential failures.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a fascinating case study: a developer-focused platform that makes a laudable, user-friendly choice to reject forced arbitration while still wrapping itself in the standard, ironclad liability shields of a modern tech corporation.",

If a catastrophic failure at GitLab—such as the permanent deletion of your company's entire codebase—destroys your business, the absolute maximum financial responsibility they accept is  or the fees you paid in the previous year. This places almost all the business risk on the user.\n\n6. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: No Guarantee of a Functional or Secure Service\nOriginal Text: \"THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS. GITLAB MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE... INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT...\"\nPlain English Explanation: GitLab makes zero legal promises that its service will work, be reliable, or be secure. They do not guarantee your code will be safe from breaches or that the service will be available when you need it. By using the platform, you legally accept 100% of the risk of its potential failures.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a fascinating case study: a developer-focused platform that makes a laudable, user-friendly choice to reject forced arbitration while still wrapping itself in the standard, ironclad liability shields of a modern tech corporation.",

    "raw_content": "This is the legal architecture of a predator's playground. Let's dismantle it.\n\nHow the Snapchat Terms of Service Enable Predators\n\nBefore looking at the individual clauses, we must understand the systemic environment this document and the product it governs create. Snapchat's ToS is a legal shield for a platform design that is, by its very nature, uniquely suited for exploitation.\n\nThe Architecture of Disappearing Evidence (Ephemerality): The core feature of Snapchat is \"disappearing\" messages and photos. This is the single most powerful tool a predator could ask for. It creates a powerful incentive for risky behavior and systematically destroys the evidence of grooming, coercion, and the exchange of illicit materials. The ToS legally frames this as a \"fun\" feature while providing the corporation with zero liability for how it is weaponized.\n\nThe Illusion of Privacy, The Reality of Surveillance: The app feels private and ephemeral, encouraging users, especially children, to share content they would never post publicly. However, the ToS reveals the truth: Snap can and does access, store, and review this \"disappearing\" content. This gap between the user's perception of privacy and the company's legal right to surveil is a critical vulnerability that predators exploit to build trust with victims.\n\nThe Weaponization of Location (Snap Map): The \"Snap Map\" feature shares a user's real-time, physical location with their \"friends.\" For a child, a \"friend\" can easily be a predator who has gained their trust. This feature is a digital tool for real-world stalking. The ToS secures the user's \"consent\" to this constant location tracking, providing legal cover for a feature that can directly lead to physical harm.\n\nThe License to a Child's Likeness (Biometrics for Lenses): The popular \"Lenses\" feature works by scanning a user's face. The ToS secures a sweeping license to the user's \"likeness\" and \"voice.\" This normalizes the act of giving a corporation biometric data from a young age and grants them broad rights to use and modify a child's face and image.\n\nThis combination of features, all legally protected by the ToS, does not just allow predators to operate; it creates a near-perfect, low-evidence, high-trust environment for them to operate.\n\nSnapchat Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 5/100\nJustification: This document is a masterclass in predatory legal design. It pairs a product philosophy that inherently enables abuse and destroys evidence with an ironclad legal framework that strips users of all meaningful recourse. The combination of forced arbitration, a class action waiver, a sweeping license to a user's biometric data (likeness), aggressive liability caps, and a core feature (ephemerality) that protects abusers makes this one of the most dangerous and non-transparent agreements for a young user base in the entire tech industry.\n\n1. The Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: The Ultimate Shield Against Accountability\nOriginal Text: \"YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT... DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most dangerous clause. It forbids you from suing Snap in a real court. Critically, it bans you from joining with other families if a widespread problem affects many children (like a design flaw that enables predators or a massive data breach). By forcing victims into secret, individual, and expensive arbitration, this clause makes it nearly impossible to hold Snap accountable for systemic failures that endanger children.\n\n2. The \"Everything You Are\" License: They Get Rights to Your Content, Your Name, Your Voice, and Your Face\nOriginal Text: \"...you grant Snap, its affiliates, and its business partners a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content... You also grant us... the right to use your name, likeness, and voice...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the \"God License,\" but it's worse here than on other platforms. You are not just giving them a license to your photos and videos. You are giving them a perpetual, free, worldwide license to your name, your voice, and your face (likeness). This is the legal \"consent\" for them to use your biometric data for features like Lenses and to use your very identity in connection with the content you create, all without ever paying you.\n\n3. The Ephemerality Lie: \"Disappearing\" Doesn't Mean Gone\nOriginal Text: \"While our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. We may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.\"\nPlain English Explanation: The app's entire premise is that content disappears. This clause reveals the legal truth: it doesn't, not really. Snap explicitly states they keep your \"deleted\" content on their backup servers for an undefined \"limited period\" and can hold onto it indefinitely for legal reasons. This means the evidence a predator might think is gone could still exist on Snap's servers, but the user is given a false sense of security.\n\n4. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for What Happens on Their Platform\nOriginal Text: \"WE... WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES... ARISING FROM... THE CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer. Snap legally states that they are not responsible for what other people do on their service. If your child is harmed, groomed, or exploited by another user, this clause is designed to ensure that you cannot hold Snap legally or financially responsible for the harm that occurred on their platform.\n\n5. The Standard  Liability Cap\nOriginal Text: \"...OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF  OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS FOR ANY PAID SERVICES.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Even in a rare case where they are found liable for causing you harm, this clause caps their total financial responsibility at a maximum of  for free users. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for even the most catastrophic failures that could ruin a life.\n\n6. Parental Liability: If Your Child Uses It, You Are Legally Responsible\nOriginal Text: \"If you are under 18... you may only use the Services with the permission of a parent or legal guardian... If you are a parent or legal guardian... you agree to these Terms on the minor's behalf and you are fully responsible for the acts of that minor...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause transfers all legal responsibility from the corporation to the parent. By letting your child use the app, you are legally agreeing to all of these predatory terms on their behalf. You are agreeing to the arbitration clause, the liability waivers, and the content licenses for your child. You become fully responsible for everything they do, and you waive their right to hold the company accountable.\n\nThis analysis is complete. You were right. This is one of the worst ones. The legal document provides the perfect cover for a product design that is uniquely dangerous in the hands of a vulnerable child.",

The analysis begins now.\n\nBlackRock Terms and Conditions: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 10/100\nJustification: This document is a masterclass in absolute legal insulation. It is a dense, uncompromising fortress of disclaimers designed to transfer 100% of the risk for the accuracy and use of its information to the user. While it does not contain user-hostile clauses like forced arbitration (as it's a UK document), its liability and warranty disclaimers are so total and absolute that they serve the same purpose: to make the corporation functionally immune to legal challenge from users of its public site. The score is profoundly low because the document's primary purpose is to create a one-way street of risk, where the user bears all potential consequences.\n\n1. The \"Information is Worthless\" Disclaimer: An Absolute Denial of Accuracy and Reliability\nOriginal Text: \"BlackRock does not warrant the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the information and materials and expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the information and materials. No warranty of any kind, implied, expressed or statutory, including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and freedom from computer virus, is given in conjunction with the information and materials.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most important clause. It legally states that BlackRock provides zero guarantees about the financial information, data, and materials on its own website. They do not promise that it is accurate, complete, or even free from computer viruses. By using the site, you legally agree that the information you are reading could be wrong, and you cannot hold them responsible for any errors.\n\n2. The Ironclad \"No Liability\" Shield: If You Lose Money, It Is 100% Your Fault\nOriginal Text: \"In no event will BlackRock be liable for any damages, including without limitation direct or indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, losses or expenses arising in connection with this site or use thereof or inability to use by any party, or in connection with any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus or line or system failure...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is their legal fortress. It means that if you make a financial decision based on faulty information from their site and lose your life savings, or if a computer virus from their site destroys your system, they have zero legal or financial responsibility for your losses. This clause is designed to make them completely immune from the consequences of any failure of their own website.\n\n3. The \"This is Not Advice\" Clause: A Legal Wall Against Responsibility\nOriginal Text: \"Nothing on this site should be construed as a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to acquire or dispose of any investment or to engage in any other transaction. Nothing on this site constitutes investment, legal, tax or other advice nor is it to be relied upon in making an investment decision.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is a critical legal shield for any financial institution. It explicitly states that nothing you read on their website is to be considered professional investment advice. This prevents users from suing them by claiming \"BlackRock's website advised me to make this investment, and I lost money.\" They are providing data, but legally disclaiming any advisory role.\n\n4. The \"We Own Everything\" Intellectual Property Clause\nOriginal Text: \"Copyright in the pages and in the screens displaying the pages, and in the information and material therein and in their arrangement, is owned by BlackRock unless otherwise indicated... You may not reproduce... modify, publicly display... or otherwise use for any public or commercial purposes any of the materials or information on this site without the express written permission of BlackRock.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause establishes their absolute ownership of everything on the site. You are forbidden from using any of their data, charts, reports, or text for any commercial purpose without their written permission. It ensures that the information they provide, even if disclaimed as inaccurate, remains their exclusive and valuable property.\n\n5. The Home Court Advantage: You Must Sue Them in England\nOriginal Text: \"This site is governed by the laws of England and Wales... you agree that the English courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of your use of this site.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause dictates the legal battleground. Any legal dispute you have with BlackRock related to this website must be filed and litigated in the courts of England.

    "raw_content": "Robinhood Customer Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 5/100\nJustification: This is a dense, labyrinthine document that combines the worst predatory clauses from both the financial and tech industries. It features one of the most aggressive and comprehensive forced arbitration and class action waiver clauses possible. It grants the company the extraordinary power to lend out a user's fully paid-for shares and to restrict or halt trading at its sole discretion. These powers, combined with absolute disclaimers of liability and warranty, create a system of near-total corporate control and near-zero corporate accountability. This document is a masterclass in legally transferring all conceivable risk from the broker to the customer.\n\n1. The Ultimate Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Your Legal Rights Are Completely Forfeited\nOriginal Text: \"This agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause... By signing an arbitration agreement the parties agree as follows: All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court... Arbitration awards are generally final and binding... The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited... The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award... The panel of arbitrators may include arbitrators... who were or are affiliated with the securities industry. The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration... NO PERSON SHALL BRING A PUTATIVE OR CERTIFIED CLASS ACTION TO ARBITRATION, NOR SEEK TO ENFORCE ANY PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AGAINST ANY PERSON WHO HAS INITIATED IN COURT A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most important and dangerous clause in the entire document. It is a complete and total waiver of your right to a fair legal process. You cannot sue Robinhood in a real court. You cannot be part of a jury trial. You cannot join a class-action lawsuit if they harm millions of users at once. You are forced into a private, binding arbitration system where the arbitrators can be from the securities industry, discovery is limited, and they don't even have to explain their decisions. This clause is specifically designed to make it almost impossible for customers to hold the company accountable for systemic failures.\n\n2. The Power to Lend Your Shares: They Can Profit from the Stocks You \"Own\"\nOriginal Text: \"When you purchase securities, they may be held in 'street name,' which means Robinhood is the registered owner... You agree that, in exchange for the commission-free services Robinhood provides... Robinhood may, without notice to me, lend to itself or others any of the securities held in my Margin and Robinhood Financial Accounts. In connection with such loans, Robinhood may receive and retain certain benefits to which I am not entitled.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an extraordinary clause. It states that Robinhood can take the stocks that you have fully paid for and lend them out to other parties (like short-sellers) without telling you. Robinhood then collects the fees and interest from these loans and keeps all of it. While you \"own\" the shares, this clause gives them the right to use your assets to make money for themselves.\n\n3. The Power to Halt Trading: The \"Sole Discretion\" Kill Switch\nOriginal Text: \"I understand that Robinhood may, in its sole discretion, prohibit or restrict the trading of securities, or the substitution of securities, in any of my Accounts.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Robinhood the absolute right to stop you from buying or selling any stock at any time, for any reason they choose. This is the legal justification for actions like restricting the purchase of \"meme stocks.\" It grants them total control over your ability to participate in the market through their platform, and you have no recourse if their decision causes you to lose money.\n\n4. The \"Payment for Order Flow\" Clause: Your Trades Are Their Product\nOriginal Text: \"I understand that Robinhood may receive payment for order flow... Robinhood may receive compensation for routing my orders to a particular broker or dealer for execution. The source and nature of any compensation received in connection with a particular transaction will be furnished upon written request.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause explains the core of their \"commission-free\" business model. They take your stock trades and sell them to large, high-frequency trading firms (market makers). These firms pay Robinhood for the right to execute your trades, often profiting from the tiny price differences. While legal, this means that you are not just the customer; your trading activity is the product being sold.\n\n5. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Losses\nOriginal Text: \"Under no circumstances shall Robinhood be liable for any consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages... regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether Robinhood was advised of the possibility of such damages. ...Robinhood shall not be liable to me for any losses... sustained by me in my Accounts.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. It states that Robinhood is not legally or financially responsible for any losses you experience in your account, even if those losses are due to their system's failure, errors, or delays. This transfers the entire financial risk of using their trading platform from them to you.\n\n6. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: No Guarantee of a Functional or Secure Service\nOriginal Text: \"The Robinhood services are provided 'as is' and 'as available.' Robinhood disclaims all warranties and representations of any kind with respect to the Robinhood services...\"\nPlain English Explanation: Robinhood makes zero legal promises that its app will work, be reliable, or be secure. They do not guarantee that it will be available when you need it (e.g., during a volatile market period). By using the app, you legally accept 100% of the risk of its potential technical failures, which in a financial context, can be catastrophic.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a fortress of legal clauses designed to grant the company maximum control over customer assets and market access, while simultaneously stripping customers of their most fundamental legal rights and insulating the company from nearly all forms of liability.",
    "cleaned_content": "Robinhood Customer Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 5/100\nJustification: This is a dense, labyrinthine document that combines the worst predatory clauses from both the financial and tech industries. It features one of the most aggressive and comprehensive forced arbitration and class action waiver clauses possible. It grants the company the extraordinary power to lend out a user's fully paid-for shares and to restrict or halt trading at its sole discretion. These powers, combined with absolute disclaimers of liability and warranty, create a system of near-total corporate control and near-zero corporate accountability. This document is a masterclass in legally transferring all conceivable risk from the broker to the customer.\n\n1. The Ultimate Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Your Legal Rights Are Completely Forfeited\nOriginal Text: \"This agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause... By signing an arbitration agreement the parties agree as follows: All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court... Arbitration awards are generally final and binding... The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited... The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award... The panel of arbitrators may include arbitrators... who were or are affiliated with the securities industry. The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration...

    "raw_content": "Coinbase User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score\n\nTransparency Score: 5/100\nJustification: This document is an almost perfect example of a predatory, user-hostile legal agreement. It is a labyrinth of cross-referenced policies that culminates in one of the most comprehensive forced arbitration and class action waiver clauses in the industry. It grants Coinbase extraordinary power, including the right to take a user's assets to cover their losses (the \"setoff\" and \"security interest\" clauses) and the right to suspend access to a user's funds and account at its sole discretion. These powers, combined with absolute disclaimers of liability for the security and operation of its platform, create a system of total corporate control over a user's digital assets with virtually no meaningful legal recourse for the user. It is a legal masterpiece of risk transference.\n\n1. The Ultimate Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Your Legal Rights are Annihilated\nOriginal Text: \"WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL... By entering into this Agreement, you... agree to waive your right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action lawsuit... ALL DISPUTES... MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is the most dangerous and important clause in the entire document. You are permanently and completely forbidden from suing Coinbase in a real court of law. You are explicitly banned from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit if Coinbase suffers a catastrophic hack, systemic failure, or engages in practices that harm millions of users at once. You are forced into a secret, private, and individual arbitration process. This clause is specifically designed to make it practically impossible to hold the company accountable for large-scale failures.\n\n2. The Power to Seize Your Assets: The \"Setoff\" and \"Security Interest\" Clauses\nOriginal Text: \"Setoff and Security Interest. You grant us a lien on, and a right of setoff against, and a security interest in, all of your rights, title and interest in and to... all of your Digital Assets and Fiat Currency... for any and all obligations and liabilities you owe to us... We may setoff any of your liabilities or obligations to us against any of your rights, title or interests in and to any of your Digital Assets and Fiat Currency, without notice to you.\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an extraordinary and aggressive clause. It means that you grant Coinbase a legal claim (a \"lien\" and \"security interest\") over all the money and crypto you hold in your account. If Coinbase decides you owe them money for any reason (like a disputed transaction or a system error), this clause gives them the right to take your assets directly from your account to cover the debt, without even notifying you. This effectively gives them the power of a debt collector and a court, combined.\n\n3. The \"Sole Discretion\" Kill Switch: They Can Freeze Your Account and Funds at Will\nOriginal Text: \"We may, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice... suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Coinbase Services, and/or deactivate or cancel your Coinbase Account(s).\"\nPlain English Explanation: This clause gives Coinbase the absolute, dictatorial right to freeze you out of your account and prevent you from accessing your money and crypto at any time, for any reason they choose. They do not need to provide a warning or an explanation. In the volatile crypto market, being unable to access your funds for even a short period can be financially catastrophic. This clause gives them total control over your market access.\n\n4. The \"Unclaimed Property\" Clause: If You Go Inactive, Your Crypto Goes to the Government\nOriginal Text: \"If Coinbase is holding funds... and has no record of you interacting with the Coinbase Services for several years, Coinbase may be required to report these funds as unclaimed property in accordance with applicable law... If this occurs, Coinbase will attempt to locate you at the address shown in our records, but if Coinbase is unable to locate you, it may be required to deliver any such funds to the applicable state or jurisdiction as unclaimed property.\"\nPlain English Explanation: If you do not log in to your account for a period of several years (the exact time depends on state law), Coinbase may be legally required to hand over all of your crypto and cash to the state government as \"unclaimed property.\" While this is a legal requirement, many users are unaware that their long-term \"hodl\" strategy could result in their assets being seized by the state if they are not actively managing their account.\n\n5. The Absolute Liability Shield: Zero Responsibility for Hacks or Losses\nOriginal Text: \"IN NO EVENT SHALL COINBASE... BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND... ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE COINBASE SERVICES...\"\nPlain English Explanation: This is an ironclad disclaimer of responsibility. It states that Coinbase is not legally or financially responsible for losses you suffer, even if those losses are due to their system's failure, errors, or delays. Crucially, this is designed to protect them from liability in the event of a hack or security breach that results in the theft of your digital assets.\n\n6. The \"As Is\" Warranty Disclaimer: The Platform is Not Guaranteed to Be Secure or Functional\nOriginal Text: \"The Coinbase services are provided on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory.\"\nPlain English Explanation: Coinbase makes zero legal promises that its platform will work correctly, be reliable, or, most importantly, be secure. By using their service, you are legally accepting 100% of the immense risk associated with the technical and security failures of a cryptocurrency exchange, which can result in the total and irreversible loss of your assets.\n\nThis analysis is complete. The document is a legal fortress designed to grant the company maximum control over user assets while simultaneously absolving it of nearly all liability for the immense risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. The combination of the \"setoff\" clause and the forced arbitration clause is particularly predatory.",
