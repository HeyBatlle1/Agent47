const openaiAnalysis = `OpenAI Terms of Use: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 30/100
Justification: While structured more clearly than older "horror movie" ToS documents, this agreement is a masterclass in transferring immense risk and responsibility from the corporation to the individual user. It grants ownership of AI output with one hand while securing a sweeping license to use all user data for AI training with the other. The indemnification clause is one of the most aggressive in the industry, making the user legally responsible for the AI's failures. Combined with standard user-hostile clauses like forced arbitration and a severe liability cap, this document creates a profound power imbalance, especially given the novel and unpredictable nature of the technology.

1. The Great Trade-Off: You "Own" the Output, but They Use Everything to Train the AI
Original Text: "To the extent permitted by law, you own all Input... OpenAI hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output... You agree that we have the right to use Content to provide, maintain, develop and improve our Services... This may include storing your Content in a way that helps us to improve the safety of our Services. We may also use Content you provide to us to develop and improve our Services."
Plain English Explanation: This is the central, critical deal you make with OpenAI. They grant you legal ownership of the text and images the AI generates for you ("Output"). However, in exchange, you grant them the right to use everything‚Äîyour prompts ("Input") and the AI's responses ("Output")‚Äîto train, develop, and improve their future AI models. While they may offer an opt-out for some services, the default agreement is that your interactions are the free raw material for their next generation of products.

2. The Ultimate Risk Transfer: You are Legally Responsible for the AI's Mistakes
Original Text: "You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, including your subsequent use of content generated by the Services... and your breach of these Terms..."
Plain English Explanation: This is arguably the most predatory and important clause in the entire document. It means that if you use something ChatGPT generates and it gets you sued (for example, it generates defamatory text, copyrighted code, or dangerously incorrect advice), you are legally required to pay for OpenAI's lawyers and all associated costs. You, the user, are held 100% responsible for the failures and flaws of their product. This is a complete transfer of legal and financial risk from the creator of the technology to the user.

3. The Forced Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Stripping Your Legal Rights
Original Text: "YOU AND OPENAI AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US... THROUGH BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION... YOU AND OPENAI WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE RESOLVED IN COURT... YOU AND OPENAI AGREE THAT EACH OF US CAN ONLY BRING A CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER OF US CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION..."
Plain English Explanation: This clause forbids you from suing OpenAI in a real court and bans you from joining with other users in a class-action lawsuit. This is especially dangerous for AI, where systemic issues like widespread bias, security flaws, or harmful outputs could affect millions of users at once. This clause ensures those systemic problems cannot be challenged collectively, drastically reducing consumer power and corporate accountability.

4. The "AI is Unreliable" Disclaimer: They Legally Guarantee Nothing
Original Text: "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study... Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You must evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output."
Plain English Explanation: This is both an honest warning and a legal shield. OpenAI explicitly states that their AI can be wrong, make things up, and be completely inaccurate. By using the service, you legally agree that the entire burden of fact-checking and verifying the AI's output is on you. You cannot hold them responsible for any damages caused by acting on false or flawed information generated by their product.

5. The Aggressive Liability Cap: The Standard $100 Limit
Original Text: "Our aggregate liability under these Terms will not exceed the greater of the amount you paid for the Service... in the 12 months before the liability arose or one hundred dollars ($100)."
Plain English Explanation: Even in a situation where OpenAI is found to be legally liable for causing you harm, this clause caps their total financial responsibility at a maximum of $100 for free users. This protects them from any meaningful financial consequence for even the most catastrophic failures.

6. The High-Risk Activity Ban: A Further Transfer of Responsibility
Original Text: "You must not use our Services for activities that have high risk of physical harm, including... weapons development; military and warfare... You must not use our Services for activities that have high risk of economic harm, including... providing tailored financial advice to individuals without a qualified person reviewing the information."
Plain English Explanation: This clause forbids you from using their AI for high-stakes activities. While this appears to be a safety measure, it also functions as a powerful legal defense for them. If someone uses their AI to make a disastrous financial decision or for a dangerous purpose, OpenAI can point to this clause and argue that the user was violating the terms, further shifting all blame and responsibility away from the company and onto the individual.

This analysis is complete. The document is a blueprint for a new kind of power imbalance, one where users are granted phenomenal creative tools but are simultaneously stripped of legal recourse and burdened with the full legal and financial liability for the tool's unpredictable and potentially flawed outputs.
