  const contextContent = `The Verifier: Reforging Deception Tools into Public Shields
Educational Context Card - Integrated Content Verification System

Mission Statement: This is not just a feature; it's a statement. It takes the very tools used for deception and reforges them into shields for the public.

The Digital Literacy Crisis

In an era where AI-generated content is indistinguishable from reality, where deepfakes spread faster than truth, and where digital manipulation is democratized, users are defenseless. They share content without understanding what information it contains, post on platforms without knowing what rights they're surrendering, and navigate digital spaces without the tools that the platforms themselves use to monitor them.

The Verifier addresses this asymmetric information problem by providing users with the same analytical capabilities that platforms have, but in service of transparency rather than control.

Core Functions of The Verifier Agent

1. AI-Generated Media Detection (The Deepfake Detector)
   - Analyzes pixels, compression artifacts, and subtle inconsistencies
   - Provides AI Genesis Score (0-100% probability of AI origin)
   - Uses traffic-light system: Green (likely authentic), Yellow (signs of editing), Red (high probability AI)
   - Never claims absolute certainty - provides evidence and probabilities

2. Digital Provenance Check (Reverse Image Search on Steroids)
   - Scans internet for other appearances of the media
   - Provides Source History report showing first online appearance
   - Helps debunk false context (e.g., "local tragedy" video from different country)
   - Identifies stolen or misrepresented content

3. Metadata Analysis (The Digital Fingerprints)
   - Examines hidden EXIF data within files
   - Reveals camera information, timestamps, GPS locations, editing software
   - Includes critical warning: metadata easily faked and often stripped
   - Focuses on privacy implications rather than absolute proof

4. Link & File Safety Scan (The Phishing Detector)
   - Scans URLs for malicious domains and phishing attempts
   - Analyzes files for hidden executable code
   - Checks against known malicious patterns
   - Provides clear safety verdicts with recommendations

Integration with ToS Salad Mission

The Verifier perfectly extends ToS Salad's transparency mission:

Legal Code Analysis ‚Üí Digital Content Analysis
- ToS Salad analyzes the legal code that governs our digital lives
- The Verifier analyzes the digital content itself
- Together they provide complete transparency about digital platform interactions

Cross-Platform Risk Assessment:
- Understand how verified content risks relate to specific platform ToS
- Identify potential violations before sharing content
- Correlate content characteristics with platform policies

Educational Transparency:
- No absolute certainty claims - always provides probabilities
- Complete method transparency - all techniques documented
- Privacy paramount - files deleted immediately after analysis

The Asymmetric Information Solution

Platforms have sophisticated tools to analyze user content:
- AI detection algorithms
- Reverse image search capabilities
- Metadata extraction systems
- Threat detection mechanisms

Users have historically had none of these tools. The Verifier changes this dynamic.

This levels the playing field by giving users insight into:
- What information their content actually contains
- How platforms might analyze their submissions
- What risks they face when sharing content
- How to make informed decisions about digital platform use

Ethical Guardrails

1. No Absolute Certainty Principle
   - Always presents probabilities, not verdicts
   - Empowers critical thinking rather than replacing it
   - Example: "98% probability of AI generation" not "This is a deepfake"

2. Privacy Paramount Policy
   - All files analyzed in secure, isolated environment
   - Permanent deletion immediately after analysis
   - No storage of user content or identifying information

3. Complete Transparency Commitment
   - All analysis methods documented and explained
   - Data sources and APIs clearly identified
   - Open about limitations and potential errors

The Statement This Makes

By integrating The Verifier into ToS Salad, we make a clear statement:

"The tools of deception can be reforged into shields of protection. The same technologies used to manipulate and mislead can be turned toward transparency and truth. We refuse to accept an information asymmetry where platforms have all the analytical power and users have none."

This is digital literacy as resistance. This is transparency as empowerment.
