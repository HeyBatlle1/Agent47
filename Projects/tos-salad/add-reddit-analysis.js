  const redditContent = `Reddit User Agreement: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 18/100
Justification: This agreement is designed to maximize Reddit's legal protection while minimizing user rights. It combines aggressive content licensing with forced arbitration, complete liability disclaimers, and unilateral control over user accounts. The low score reflects Reddit's systematic approach to extracting maximum value from user content while providing minimal protections or recourse for users. The agreement is particularly hostile to content creators who generate the valuable discussions that drive the platform.

1. The "We Own Everything You Post" License: Perpetual, Irrevocable Rights to All User Content
Original Text: "By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights. You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content: When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world."
Plain English Explanation: This is one of the most aggressive content licensing clauses in social media. When you post anything on Reddit—comments, posts, images, videos—you grant them permanent, irrevocable rights to use, modify, and distribute that content forever, even if you delete your account. They can sell your content to AI companies, use it in advertising, or create derivative works without ever paying you. The "transferable and sublicensable" language means they can sell these rights to other companies. You are essentially working for free to create Reddit's most valuable asset: user-generated content.

2. Forced Arbitration: You Cannot Sue Reddit in Court
Original Text: "Any Dispute between you and Reddit will be resolved through binding individual arbitration... You and Reddit agree that any Dispute will be settled solely by binding individual arbitration and not in a class action, representative action, or other similar proceeding... THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT... YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND REDDIT MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING."
Plain English Explanation: This clause removes your right to sue Reddit in public court and prevents class action lawsuits. Instead, you must use private arbitration, which is expensive, secretive, and historically favors corporations. If Reddit violates your rights, steals your content, or causes you harm, you cannot join with other users in a class action lawsuit. You must fight them alone, in private, with an arbitrator that corporations typically prefer. This effectively shields Reddit from most legal accountability.

3. Complete Liability Shield: Reddit is Not Responsible for Any Damages
Original Text: "IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, WILL REDDIT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES... REDDIT'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO REDDIT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION."
Plain English Explanation: This clause means Reddit accepts almost zero legal responsibility for any harm their platform causes you. If their platform spreads misinformation that damages your reputation, if a data breach exposes your personal information, if their algorithm promotes harassment against you, or if their negligence causes you financial loss—their maximum liability is $100 or what you paid them (often $0). This transfers all the risk of using their platform from them to you.

4. Unilateral Account Termination: They Can Delete Your Account and Content Anytime
Original Text: "Reddit may terminate or suspend your Reddit account or ability to access or use the Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms... Upon termination of your account, your right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. Termination of your account does not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability you may have to Reddit or any third party."
Plain English Explanation: Reddit can delete your account, and years of posts and comments, at any time for any reason without warning. If you've built a following or used Reddit for business networking, they can destroy that with no recourse. Even after termination, you're still bound by their terms (like the content license), but they have no obligations to you. This gives them ultimate power over your digital presence on their platform.

5. Unlimited Right to Change Terms: They Can Rewrite the Rules Anytime
Original Text: "We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the revised Terms and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services... By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms."
Plain English Explanation: Reddit can change these terms at any time, and your continued use means you automatically agree to whatever new terms they create. They can decide what constitutes "material" changes and whether to notify you. This means the agreement you thought you were signing could be completely different tomorrow, and you have no choice but to accept it or stop using the platform entirely.

6. No Warranty on Service Quality: Reddit Provides No Guarantees
Original Text: "THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT... REDDIT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE."
Plain English Explanation: Reddit makes no promises that their service will work, be secure, or be available when you need it. If the platform goes down during important discussions, if security flaws expose your data, or if bugs cause you to lose content, they have no legal obligation to fix these problems or compensate you for any losses.

7. User Content Responsibility Shift: You're Liable for Everything, They're Liable for Nothing
Original Text: "You are solely responsible for Your Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it... Reddit takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Content posted, stored, uploaded, or otherwise made available by you or any third party."
Plain English Explanation: This clause makes you legally responsible for everything you post, but makes Reddit responsible for nothing that appears on their platform. If someone posts defamatory content about you, Reddit isn't liable. If you accidentally violate someone's copyright, you're fully liable even though Reddit profits from hosting that content. This creates a one-way liability structure where users bear all the legal risks while Reddit reaps all the benefits.

8. Data Collection and Sharing: Broad Rights to Monitor and Monetize User Activity
Original Text: "We may use information about you to... provide, maintain, and improve the Services; research and develop new services; send you technical notices, security alerts, and administrative messages; communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you..."
Plain English Explanation: This gives Reddit expansive rights to collect, analyze, and use your personal data for their business purposes. They can monitor your activity patterns, interests, and behaviors to build detailed profiles for advertising. While they claim to anonymize data, the combination of posting history, voting patterns, and engagement data can create highly specific user profiles that have significant commercial value.

The Reddit User Agreement represents a systematic approach to maximizing platform value while minimizing corporate responsibility, creating a fundamentally imbalanced relationship between the platform and its content-creating users.
