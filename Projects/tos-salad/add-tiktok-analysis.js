  const tiktokContent = `TikTok Terms of Service: Key Clause Analysis & Transparency Score

Transparency Score: 12/100
Justification: TikTok's Terms of Service represent one of the most aggressively user-hostile agreements in social media. The agreement combines extremely broad content licensing (including transferable rights), complete waiver of personal rights including likeness and voice, automated surveillance, parental liability transfers, shortened legal deadlines, and comprehensive corporate liability shields. Most critically, it specifically targets minors while making parents fully liable for all consequences. The score reflects systematic exploitation of both users and families, with particular concern for child safety and parental financial exposure.

1. The "God License": Irrevocable, Permanent, and Transferable Rights to Your Content
Original Text: "...by submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, perpetual worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented."
Plain English Explanation: This is the most important clause. It means that the moment you upload a video, you grant TikTok a permanent ("perpetual"), unstoppable ("irrevocable") right to do almost anything they want with it, for free, forever. They can modify it, create new works from it (like for ads), and even transfer or sell these rights to other companies ("fully transferable"). It also gives every other user and third-party companies the right to download and re-use your content, which is the basis for features like Duet and Stitch.

2. Waiver of All Personal Rights: You Forfeit Control Over Your Own Image and Likeness
Original Text: "You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content... By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content..."
Plain English Explanation: This clause means TikTok can use your face, voice, and name in connection with your videos without asking your permission or paying you. Crucially, you waive your right to approve how they use your likeness in their own marketing or ads. This is an enormous concession of personal privacy and publicity rights, which is especially concerning for minors.

3. Financial Responsibility is on You: The User Indemnifies TikTok for Copyright Claims
Original Text: "This means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.)..."
Plain English Explanation: This describes that if you use a popular song in your video, you are granting TikTok a free license for that music. If the record label or music publisher later sues TikTok for copyright infringement over your video, other clauses (like the Indemnity clause) could place the financial responsibility back on you, the user, for not having the proper rights.

4. Automated Content Scanning: Constant Monitoring of Your Activity
Original Text: "Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored."
Plain English Explanation: This clause states that TikTok's software automatically scans and analyzes all content you create and interact with. This is used to personalize your feed and ads. The mention of "emails" is unusual and may be boilerplate language, but as written, it suggests a very broad scope of automated analysis of user data.

5. Total Indemnification: If TikTok is Sued Because of You, You Pay
Original Text: "You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TikTok... from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and expenses, arising out of a breach by you or any user of your account of these Terms..."
Plain English Explanation: This is a standard but severe clause. It means that if TikTok faces a lawsuit because of something you did, posted, or uploaded, you are legally obligated to pay for their lawyers, court costs, and any financial damages. This transfers a massive amount of legal risk from the corporation to the individual user.

6. The "As Is" Clause & Data Loss: TikTok is Not Responsible for Anything
Original Text: "THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS"... WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR... (III) ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED BY YOU... (IV) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF... ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADVERTISING..."
Plain English Explanation: TikTok makes no promises that the service will be safe, secure, or reliable. They are not liable if they lose all of your data, videos, and memories. They are also not responsible if you suffer damage by relying on the accuracy of any content or advertising on the platform.

7. Shortened Time to Sue: You Have Only One Year to File a Lawsuit
Original Text: "YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE... OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM..."
Plain English Explanation: This clause dramatically shortens the time you have to take legal action against TikTok. In many legal situations, you might have several years to file a claim (a "statute of limitations"). This term reduces that window to just one year, after which you permanently lose your right to sue, regardless of the circumstances.

8. Parental/Guardian Liability: Adults are Fully Responsible for Minors
Original Text: "If you are under age 18, you may only use the Services with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you."
Plain English Explanation: This places the entire legal burden on the parent or guardian of a minor user. By allowing a child to use the app, the parent is legally agreeing to all of these terms on the child's behalf—including the content licenses, waivers of rights, and indemnification clauses. They are fully responsible for everything the minor does on the platform.

9. Your Ideas Become Their Property, Instantly and Forever
Original Text: "You irrevocably grant us perpetual and unlimited permission to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, modify, publicly perform... and otherwise use and exploit the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback..."
Plain English Explanation: This clause concerns any feedback, idea, or suggestion you send to TikTok. It states that the moment you send them an idea, it becomes their property to use however they want, forever, without paying you or even giving you credit. They can use your idea to create a new commercial product, patent it, and sell it, and you have no rights or claim to it whatsoever.

10. The Rules Can Change at Any Time, and Your Only Choice is to Quit
Original Text: "We amend these Terms from time to time... We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes... however, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes... Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services."
Plain English Explanation: This describes that TikTok can change its legal agreement with you at any time. While they may try to notify you, the responsibility is on you to constantly check for updates. If they change the rules and you don't agree, your only option is to delete your account. You have no power to negotiate or reject specific changes.

11. The "Cooling Off" Period Designed to Stop Lawsuits
Original Text: "If we have a dispute with you... the party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other... If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired... either party may file legal action against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action."
Plain English Explanation: This clause forces you into a mandatory "informal dispute resolution" process before you are allowed to sue TikTok. You must first contact them and engage in this process for up to 60 days. This acts as a procedural hurdle designed to exhaust your time and resources, making it more difficult and complicated for an average person to seek justice in a court of law.

12. Your Anonymity Can Be Revoked by a Third-Party Complaint
Original Text: "We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy."
Plain English Explanation: This means your perceived anonymity is conditional. If another person or company claims your video violates their copyright or privacy rights, TikTok reserves the right to give them your real-world identity. This can expose you to legal action or harassment from third parties.

13. The "We Don't Have to Police the Platform" Shield
Original Text: "You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you and other users on the Services (including User Content)."
Plain English Explanation: This is a crucial liability shield for TikTok. It states they have no legal duty to check content before it is posted to ensure it is safe or legal. They reserve the right to take things down later, but they are not responsible for failing to catch harmful, dangerous, or illegal content before it is seen by users, including children. This puts the burden of safety on users to report content after the fact.

14. The "California Eraser" Clause (With Hurdles)
Original Text: "Users of the Services who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request and obtain removal of User Content they posted... All requests must be labeled 'California Removal Request' on the email subject line... We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, and we may not be able to respond if you do not provide adequate information."
Plain English Explanation: This section addresses a California law that gives minors the right to have their own posts removed. While TikTok provides a path to do this, they include specific procedural requirements. If a teenager (or their parent) fails to label the email correctly or provide "adequate information," TikTok states they are not responsible and may not be able to respond, potentially nullifying this legal protection on a technicality.

The combination of these clauses creates an environment of near-total corporate control and near-zero corporate liability, with particular exploitation of minors and families.
